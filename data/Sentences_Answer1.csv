0,Answer1," Ms Shinen explained that her views would be biased towards water, given that she is a member of the DOSs Water Team."
1,Answer1,"With respect to water, she felt that the major challenges in the Mekong were the very rapid pace of development; hydropower development; and a lack of coordination."
2,Answer1,"She also raised concern around the profusion of cooperation platforms in the region which, she said, are a hindrance to effective cooperation and coordination between the Mekong countries."
3,Answer1,"Water issues are political issues as is natural resource management, typically decided at high level."
4,Answer1,There are major challenges all around natural resources management in the basin.
5,Answer1,"These have, she argued, been politicised, and there is currently no real development path going forwards."
6,Answer1,"As a consequence, Ms Shinen felt that the introduction of a new cooperation mechanism was not the answer."
7,Answer1,"She suggested that WB make a detailed investigation of existing mechanisms to see what does or does not work, and then use its leverage to strengthen or improve these."
8,Answer1,There is lack of coherent coordination between cooperative mechanisms.
9,Answer1,"Stronger leadership is required, along with coordination from development partners , rather than creating a new platform."
10,Answer1,"DOS, she said, monitors events in the Mekong through a political lens, looking for what they call conservation crimes."
11,Answer1,Actor consultation is also determined through a political lens.
12,Answer1,"She summarised the DOSs engagement with a variety of international NGOs, including IUCN, WWF and Conservation International."
13,Answer1,"ACMEC, the MRC and Friends of the Mekong and an ASEAN may be the best options and warrant further examination."
14,Answer1, The ecosystem and natural resources degradation.
15,Answer1,Deforestation has been very intense because of land concessions and illegal logging.
16,Answer1,This has contributed to climate change.
17,Answer1,Hydropower expansion is also a contributing factor.
18,Answer1,"The latter is a strong concern for Cambodia, which has been heavily reliant on the Mekong for its fish."
19,Answer1,"Also flash floods, reduced flood season affecting juvenile fish growth and periodic droughts."
20,Answer1,We also observe demographic growth and strong urbanisation trends .
21,Answer1,Mr Roussel was uncertain if agriculture would remain important for Cambodia.
22,Answer1,How to reverse all of this ecosystem degradation is the key issue.
23,Answer1, USAID has a focus on transboundary environmental issues the challenges that cannot be addressed by one country alone.
24,Answer1,Unsustainable extraction and use of natural resources from across the region endangers economic growth.
25,Answer1,The need for individual countries to propel their own economic growth forwards may make sense at the individual country level but not regionally.
26,Answer1,"Amongst the challenges that Ms Hogg mentioned hydropower, forests, sand mining, and impacts on the flood pulse, unintended consequences and lack of shared management enabling equal opportunities for riparians to meet development objectives."
27,Answer1,USAID has also been looking at the potentials of low head dams.
28,Answer1,"We are concerned with a lot of the infrastructure they are not against it, but would want transparent data platforms that all stakeholders can access."
29,Answer1,"She feels that the most complete data possible is needed, and regional spaces for where data can be shared."
30,Answer1,"There needs to be, in particular, data sharing between upstream and downstream countries."
31,Answer1,There is asymmetric information availability on floods and droughts.
32,Answer1,This puts individual countries at a disadvantage.
33,Answer1,There is insufficient inclusion of civil society in dialogues.
34,Answer1,"They want their platforms to be available to civil society to understand and debate trade offs as well as the private sector to address externalities, which can be very powerful."
35,Answer1,John Ward  asks a question about the capacity to analyse data beyond just data gathering.
36,Answer1,Ms Hogg mentions SERVIR Mekong as an example of USAID supported initiatives in this respect.
37,Answer1,"High quality data is needed, but she acknowledged that information overload could also be a problem."
38,Answer1,"The Mekong Infrastructure Tracker, an online platform  was introduced to stakeholders."
39,Answer1,"She said that it can reveal the impacts of infrastructure, and can help countries to decide which infrastructure should be developed."
40,Answer1,Ms Hogg described it as a planning tool.
41,Answer1,"Ms Hogg mentions that they have recently signed an agreement with WWF that will look to support civil society to access data, and use it to gain influence."
42,Answer1," Broadly, weak governance domestically."
43,Answer1,"In Laos, weak rule of law, and an absent civil society."
44,Answer1,This weak governance means that investments take precedence over the law.
45,Answer1,"Weak governance can play into the hands of many, but Mr Imboden is thinking particularly about the PRC."
46,Answer1, Mr Parks
47,Answer1,": There is a lot of geo political competition, which provides the opportunity to connect with a wide range of multilateral partners."
48,Answer1,But it also forces countries to make choices that they might not have otherwise.
49,Answer1,There are also large transparency challenges.
50,Answer1,"In water governance, transparency has been a challenge."
51,Answer1,Differences between countries.
52,Answer1,"In Laos, the rule of law is weak, so water is vulnerable to capture by internal and external elites."
53,Answer1,Thailand is keen to be a regional player even trying to shape safeguards in Laos.
54,Answer1,Mr Zawacki: he agrees with Mr Parks.
55,Answer1,Geopolitics overlay a variety of technical sustainable development issues.
56,Answer1,"He adds, servicing, navigating and negotiating the 13 frameworks is a challenge to sustainable development."
57,Answer1,"It takes great time and energy to do this, and if sustainable development were to emerge from this, it would be happenstance."
58,Answer1,The water levels on the Mekong  have been a huge challenge to sustainable development.
59,Answer1,Mr Zawacki also identifies the on going disconnect between government and civil society.
60,Answer1,"These two sets of actors do not speak the same language, and do not agree on what sustainable development is, let alone what sustainable is or even development."
61,Answer1,"At government to government levels, there seems to be agreement on what sustainable development is; the same is true amongst very diverse NGOs and CSOs."
62,Answer1,"But these are two different parallel tracks, with no connection."
63,Answer1,There is no common SD lexicon and distrust.
64,Answer1,"Governments look more at economic factors, while CSOs/NGOs more at the environment."
65,Answer1,Mr Parks: points out that all of the regions countries have to report on the SDGs.
66,Answer1," At the broad level, the need to link politics, policies and projects."
67,Answer1,Geopolitics have become apparent.
68,Answer1,There have always been competing claims and interests on the river and its basin.
69,Answer1,"In any future World Bank endeavour, the relations between policies , politics and projects will need to appear."
70,Answer1,"For example, the relation between energy policy and final hydropower projects; or biodiversity policies and eventual nature conservation projects."
71,Answer1,"There is a two way link between plans, projects and policy."
72,Answer1,Projects should be purposively designed to strengthen policy.
73,Answer1,"Dr Umans lists a variety of technical challenges: climate change, land subsidence in the delta, sediments, etc."
74,Answer1,These need to feed into policies and into the field of power relations.
75,Answer1,He then refers to what he calls an abstract challenge.
76,Answer1,"Many of those involved in sustainable development are growth  and extraction oriented, and focus less on the quality of growth."
77,Answer1,"He thinks a slightly different discourse is needed, in which the river is seen as a living being, and has living rights."
78,Answer1,Its tributaries could be seen as the arms of this being.
79,Answer1,"Dr Umans feels that this resonates with European history, and that of indigenous people."
80,Answer1,"The river has its own heart , and it creates and nourishes life."
81,Answer1,He hopes that this narrative can nourish policy including that of international development.
82,Answer1,Indigenous insights are complementary to our expert approaches and it is important to not just stick to this expert narrative.
83,Answer1,Mekong Vision 3.0 should be able to accommodate these other perspectives.
84,Answer1, Mr Engler explains that he has only been in Laos for a year.
85,Answer1,National interests come first.
86,Answer1,This is a challenge to managing the basin as a whole.
87,Answer1,"There are lots of meetings, but perhaps not to the point of respecting nor honouring obligations."
88,Answer1,"Data sharing the MRC struggles to get data from its member countries, including Lancang flow data."
89,Answer1,"There are lots of frameworks, but very few have any legally binding aspects."
90,Answer1,Inclusion of civil society and the private sector is also a challenge.
91,Answer1,"Management of the rivers water is a challenge, and Mr Engler cites water quality, waste water disposal, pesticides and so on."
92,Answer1,"While the latter is not such a problem at the moment, he thinks it will become a major problem."
93,Answer1,"A new aspect is groundwater data, analysis and management."
94,Answer1,More research is needed on this.
95,Answer1,The Mekongs tributaries have not been systematically monitored.
96,Answer1,Dams are also a challenge.
97,Answer1,"Switzerland has been involved in dam safety, and has detected problems with maintenance, reporting and monitoring of dam safety issues."
98,Answer1,There are no systematic analysis of the findings and contingency plans for when a dam breaks.
99,Answer1,"This is a big problem in Laos, and the private sector needs to be more engaged and held to higher standards."
100,Answer1,The causes of the lower Mekong low river levels remains frunknown and uncertain.
101,Answer1,"Common standards across the countries are needed, including the private sector, and should be legally binding."
102,Answer1,Mr Engler also mentioned that there is no cross border framework for managing navigation.
103,Answer1, This is a pretty good place to live.
104,Answer1,The rate of  growth has been high and steady.
105,Answer1,What made sense politically and economically 25 years ago has now changed.
106,Answer1,The quality of growth is a concern.
107,Answer1,"In the Mekong Delta, Vietnam has abandoned the third rice crop, which is good."
108,Answer1,Their recent agreement with the EU will introduce new standards to manufacturing and food safety.
109,Answer1,Covid could expose the reliance on national exports and national budgets.
110,Answer1,"Countries could be In Thailand, growth is lower, and they have an ageing population."
111,Answer1,"Mr Brunner feels that higher quality growth and compliant FDI is being sought regionally, and that this is very positive."
112,Answer1,"Many problems remain, nevertheless."
113,Answer1, Six countries with six different sets of interests and motivations.
114,Answer1,"There is even diversity within the countries between sectors, for example."
115,Answer1,"In addition, there is a super power at the top of the  system, and Vietnam, at the bottom of the system, is an emerging power."
116,Answer1,The region has a history of conflict and war.
117,Answer1,The most recent the Vietnam/China dispute).
118,Answer1,There has been a polarisation of the various platforms.
119,Answer1,"The creation of the MRC, Dr Pech feels, was a reflection of the Cold War , which was why  China and Myanmar were excluded from its membership."
120,Answer1,"Hence, there is a real lower Mekong focus, which serves to exclude China."
121,Answer1,All information and unilateral development in the lower Mekong is now coming from China.
122,Answer1,"The World Bank and ADB are trying to catch up, but China and its investment banks are a more attractive source of financing."
123,Answer1,"Private and national investment banks enable short cuts for development, with less stringent safeguards ."
124,Answer1,"How, Dr Pech wonders, can we ensure that all the various cooperation frameworks apply the same rules?"
125,Answer1,"There is a lack of unity in the application of rules, or information sharing."
126,Answer1,The victims of all of this lack of coordination are the poor.
127,Answer1, Dr Sellamuttu:
128,Answer1,"Climate change and related aspects are taking on a bigger emphasis, especially in the preparation for the COP 21 meeting."
129,Answer1,"Linked to this is the CGIARs Two Degree Initiative, that will focus on mega deltas, including the Mekongs."
130,Answer1,Dr Pavlic:
131,Answer1,"Regional work on water insecurity, and a better understanding of drought."
132,Answer1,Dr McCartney:
133,Answer1,"Climate change intensifies challenges and risks for flood and drought, the impacts of land use change , river  mining, and governance, and how these challenges will be managed."
134,Answer1,Governance issues are complicated by vested interests and the fact that the basin is shared by six countries.
135,Answer1, Whoever the public sees as benefitting the most from the Mekong.
136,Answer1,"So far, it has been state to state."
137,Answer1,But sustainability is not just the government.
138,Answer1,We have to combine the micro  with the macro .
139,Answer1, Mr Hirose
140,Answer1,: There are two key challenges.
141,Answer1,"First, regional stability for development; and the rule of law, and respect for human rights."
142,Answer1,"Second, quality economic growth."
143,Answer1,"In the Tokyo strategy, quality growth focusses of connectivity and sustainable growth."
144,Answer1,"The Tokyo Strategy is an initiative of the Japanese MOFA, with consultation with other Japanese ministries, and in consultation with Mekong country ministries."
145,Answer1,Mr Suenaga: The Tokyo Strategy does not include China.
146,Answer1,"Insofar as the Mekong River is concerned, the strategy calls for a green Mekong and addresses pollution, water management and climate change."
147,Answer1, There has been a lot of change in terms of the environment.
148,Answer1,Especially water levels these are at their lowest ever.
149,Answer1,This may be because of climate change or other human interventions.
150,Answer1,There has been a lot of development in China and up country .
151,Answer1,"Mr Douangkham is uncertain if the water levels have dropped because of the latter, or because of climate change."
152,Answer1, Ms Mann:
153,Answer1,This is tricky.
154,Answer1,"Some of the frameworks have a geography in the basin, some more focused on the relations between the countries that share it."
155,Answer1,"The impact of the pandemic on the six countries, and its knock on impacts to the economy and ecologies."
156,Answer1,"She talks about a new Australian initiative called Partnerships for Recovery that responds to the pandemic, and development assistance that pivots and responds to the pandemic."
157,Answer1,"The initiative responds to three key challenges: health, stability and economic recovery, especially for the vulnerable and urban job losses."
158,Answer1,"Covid has amplified existing challenges, and creates new risks to value chains and food supply."
159,Answer1,Dr Dore:
160,Answer1,"Value, health and governance are in steep decline."
161,Answer1,"Pre Covid, there were other sustainability issues."
162,Answer1,He mentions that the Mekongs tributaries are more than just a series of gauging stations.
163,Answer1,"These issues are, however, just one slice of the larger SDG set."
164,Answer1,"The Council Study, MRC BDP and the Mekong Delta are some initiatives to examine an expanded set of sustainable development issues."
165,Answer1,"The SDGs guide sustainable development: is the focus just on water, whole of the basin or all SDGs?"
166,Answer1," The primary challenge is scarcity, which is increasing."
167,Answer1,In the past there was so much water.
168,Answer1,This is not the case now.
169,Answer1,"In southwest China, rainfall has reduced by 20%."
170,Answer1,"So, competition for water resources is increasing."
171,Answer1,The second challenge is the Mekongs flows.
172,Answer1,"So, it is a question of both volume and distribution."
173,Answer1,There has been huge development in the Mekong Delta.
174,Answer1,You need to assess how whole changes in the economy create new types of impact.
175,Answer1,"In turn, this changes the nature and the magnitude of the demand for water."
176,Answer1,"On the Tonle Sap, there has been big changes to the governance system as well by transferring 35 previous private sector fishing lots to 500 community managed lots."
177,Answer1,"The private sector lots may have been more economically efficient, but distribution was not fair."
178,Answer1,The Mekong now has a regulated flow.
179,Answer1,It is no longer natural flow.
180,Answer1,"This then has impacts in other ecosystems, such as wetlands."
181,Answer1,The primary driver of all these changes is market forces.
182,Answer1,He says that we  have not given much attention to what he calls the invisible user which is the agricultural sector.
183,Answer1,This uses 80% of water use in the Mekong.
184,Answer1,The second main driver is hydropower.
185,Answer1,"In national policies, economic development is the priority rather than conservation."
186,Answer1,"What,"
187,Answer1,"Prof. Lu wonders, do we mean by reasonable use in international rivers?"
188,Answer1,"When there is plenty of water , this does not matter, but when there is scarcity, water needs to be valued."
189,Answer1,Water rights are demarcated via treaties as substitute.
190,Answer1,"India and Pakistan is an example: where dam agreements are in place, seasonal flows agreed and there is a monitoring system."
191,Answer1, Several challenges:  
192,Answer1,unequal relations between up  and downstream countries.
193,Answer1,By upstream
194,Answer1,Prof. Monorom references China.
195,Answer1,"Economically, there are huge gaps between them."
196,Answer1,"It is in this gap that the big countries are making decisions about Mekong issues, particularly hydropower.  "
197,Answer1,"In theory civil society and non state actors are supposed to be engaged by their respective government, but in practice, this process is not meaningful."
198,Answer1,There is not much space for local knowledge.  
199,Answer1,"Marginalised people never know what is going on for example, why the water levels are low, or why the flows change so rapidly and substantially, or why there have been such drastic fisheries reductions."
200,Answer1,"There seems to be no communication between up and downstream countries , and in particular, no communication between the upstream government and the downstream communities.  "
201,Answer1,Science is not a basis for decision making in the Mekong.
202,Answer1," Mr Ren has participated in previous World Bank consultations and leads an NGO based in Beijing, focused on Sotheast Asia and the Lancang Mekong basin."
203,Answer1,"The geo political debate is the most important issue, followed by identifying stakeholders who need to be involved in debates and decisions."
204,Answer1,A question posed by Mr Ren was who determines who should be involved?
205,Answer1,"Decisions about the level of environmental protection versus economic development are important: downstream countries make use of natural and water resources to meet development objectives, typically with biodiversity losses and natural resource deterioration."
206,Answer1,"Climate change and hydropower development, including accounting for El Nio and La Nia cycles, are important."
207,Answer1, Climate change is now challenging the water resources of the Mekong.
208,Answer1,Population density is generally high.
209,Answer1,"Urbanisation is also a challenge, particularly in the upper basin."
210,Answer1,Amongst the six countries are those whose infrastructure is lagging behind.
211,Answer1,We know that there is severe pollution.
212,Answer1,She references saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta and ecosystem deterioration in Cambodia.
213,Answer1,"So too, the distribution of water over time and space varies from upstream and downstream."
214,Answer1,"In the upper basin, there is lots of rainfall during the summer, but less downstream."
215,Answer1,Drought will be more severe in the future.
216,Answer1,"So, these are some of the distinct challenges, which are getting more acute."
217,Answer1, There are many challenges.
218,Answer1,"The uneven distribution of rainfall in time and space, and more."
219,Answer1,This has been intensified by climate change.
220,Answer1,Drought has caused significant economic losses to the Mekong people.
221,Answer1,Water has become one of the key issues in the sustainable development of the Lancang Mekong .
222,Answer1,"How, Dr Zhong wondered, can we create a shared dialogue on how to do this?"
223,Answer1,All the LM countries have a right to economic development.
224,Answer1,Rapid economic development has led to natural resource declines.
225,Answer1,Sustainable growth needs to be shared by all Lancang Mekong countries.
226,Answer1,It is the responsibility of the LMC to promote the development of the individual countries people and narrow the development gap.
227,Answer1,Countries have a right to develop their economies.
228,Answer1, The main challenge is the imbalance between economic and environmental development.
229,Answer1,"There are six countries and so there are six perspectives, each with their own economic priorities and the economy is always prioritised."
230,Answer1,They never use environmental indicators or assessments in their planning.
231,Answer1,There are no environmental values indicated in EIAs.
232,Answer1,The economic losses of natural resource utilization are not included.
233,Answer1,"If these are included, then it favours the policy maker."
234,Answer1,"There are no limits to development for example, to set aside certain amounts of land, or forest, to conserve the Mekong."
235,Answer1,There are many actors involved and Mr Tek lists multiple frameworks of which he is aware.
236,Answer1,"They need to agree together what the limits to development should be, in full consultation with the people, to develop a master plan for the Mekong."
237,Answer1,"This plan should make clear that the tributaries, and connectivity between the river and the rest of the basin."
238,Answer1,We would like to see rules for the international banks.
239,Answer1,"The World Bank has recourse mechanisms, but many others do not have this."
240,Answer1,"With many developers and money owners, if people have concerns there is no way for them to express them."
241,Answer1,Enabling this should be prioritised.
242,Answer1, Dr Hatda: these are all identified in the Council Study and the MRCs State of the Basin Report .
243,Answer1,Amongst the significant ones: the permanent change to the Mekongs flow regime.
244,Answer1,"This has led to reductions to sediments, fisheries, riparian environment, wetlands, and caused significant local flooding."
245,Answer1,"To manage the mainstream, we need to understand what is happening on the tributaries."
246,Answer1,"Dr Hatda hopes that the MRCs next Strategic Plan  will address this, especially in terms of data sharing."
247,Answer1,"From January to July 2020, there was lowflow and drought in the region."
248,Answer1,"This will get more frequent, and the countries will need to work together in order to address this."
249,Answer1," First, rapid socio economic development and a very large population in the basin about 70 million; and second, climate change which increases the hydrological extremes in the basin."
250,Answer1,We have published several papers on this.
251,Answer1,The main risk is that the flood risk is increasing in the near term.
252,Answer1,"And then, drought especially severe drought, is occurring more frequently."
253,Answer1,"Prof Fuqiang argues that upstream dams can help to mitigate this, and the same is true of drought."
254,Answer1,"Finally, there is also a capacity shortage."
255,Answer1,"While we have established several cooperation frameworks, we still need additional capacity."
256,Answer1," First, the current institutional arrangement is disconnected across scales, and between institutions."
257,Answer1,Things then run in parallel without connecting.
258,Answer1,"Second, problem definition there are no agreements on problems."
259,Answer1,"For some, hydropower is a problem, for others, it is a solution."
260,Answer1,"Until this is addressed, everyone is talking at cross purposes."
261,Answer1,"Third, too many actors governments, NGOs, etc"
262,Answer1,"so there are so many overlaps and duplications between mandates, and their collective efforts are not integrated."
263,Answer1,"This creates dispersion, and ensures that there is no common vision."
264,Answer1,"Where there are visions, they do not represent local people: Representation becomes blurred."
265,Answer1, The development issues are more complex now than before especially when dealing with multiple objectives.
266,Answer1,"Water supply, hydropower etc."
267,Answer1,"and all of the different stakeholder groups, who have different objectives."
268,Answer1,We cannot go in one direction to meet our goals; we need to take an holistic approach.
269,Answer1,The lack of understanding of stakeholders are particular areas of focus.
270,Answer1,"If you ask environmentalists, they want the protection of the river, which may then lead to antagonism; policy makers want to bring the better life and they may not have many options available to them if they want to increase GDP."
271,Answer1,We need to balance between these for peace and development.
272,Answer1,Stakeholders may have access to different sets of information.
273,Answer1,The platforms that have been set up to bring them together often result in antagonism based on different information.
274,Answer1,"We need to find a peaceful way, and which institution should be responsible for this."
275,Answer1,How can the people be educated?
276,Answer1,They have to know what alternatives there are if they are to be told that they have to sacrifice something.
277,Answer1,The government needs to be committed to the people if we are to have trust.
278,Answer1,"If you promise jobs, and then you do not provide this, then they will not believe you next time."
279,Answer1,This is a serious problem.
280,Answer1,But the commitment is not just for the government to provide the people have to provide this as well.
281,Answer1,"Dr Poonpat provides an example of affected people accepting a compensation package and then, later, demanding more."
282,Answer1,"This too does not, he feels, result in trust."
283,Answer1,Trust is bi directional
284,Answer1, The biggest challenge is engagement.
285,Answer1,"The people along the Mekong have no rights to, for example, manage the resources of the river."
286,Answer1,The second big challenge is leveraging the knowledge we have to develop the Mekong.
287,Answer1,"Right now, the biggest motivation is economic development."
288,Answer1,But there has been so much research that shows that this does not work.
289,Answer1,Look at EIAs these are always conducted by just one party.
290,Answer1,"The current structure of the Mekong Rivers development includes the MRC, the LMC and the LMI, and is only conducted by the state no one else."
291,Answer1,This is not very effective because it is focussed only on economic development.
292,Answer1,The PNPCA process is not working effectively because it seems like a public hearing.
293,Answer1,The MRC has no authority to intervene or to cancel a dam that is not good.
294,Answer1,The PNPCA is just a rubber stamping exercise it cannot stop anything.
295,Answer1,The Thai government seems not to have an interest in the sustainable development of the Mekong even though it has eight provinces bordering the river.
296,Answer1,There is more interest in the Chao Phraya.
297,Answer1,"Government agencies are not, Mr Niwat says, up to date on things."
298,Answer1,"He wonders if they even know that there are 11 dams along the Mekong mainstream in China, and that there are two more on their way."
299,Answer1,They seem not to know.
300,Answer1,"Mr Niwat speaks of the current drought, which he attributes to these latter dams but the Thai government says that it is waiting for a report from the Chinese government."
301,Answer1,This is not good enough.
302,Answer1,"The Mekong is no longer a natural river, and this is not good at all."
303,Answer1,"We need now to discuss water releases, so that these can support the rivers ecology."
304,Answer1,"Also, the laws these are not issued fast enough to respond to the changing situation."
305,Answer1,"He references the Xayaburi dam, which, he says, saw a lot of money moving from Thailand to Laos."
306,Answer1,"Thai law does not address Thai investments in Laos, so developers and funders are not subject to the same standards as those operating inThailand."
307,Answer1,It is very important to list all of the challenges we are facing and to invite all the stakeholders to discuss them.
308,Answer1,He explains that his initiatives are looking to establish a council for the people living along the Mekong.
309,Answer1,"It will meet on December 1 2, 2020 in Chiang Rai, and will include civil society, and academics."
310,Answer1,He thinks that the Chinese and Thai states will be there because they are very interested in these things.
311,Answer1,Representatives from all of the eight Mekong provinces will attend.
312,Answer1,This is an effort to promote and advocate for the participation of people in the development of the Mekong.
313,Answer1,And also so we can know where the people stand with respect to this development.
314,Answer1,The power now is in the hands of the state and the private sector.
315,Answer1,"If the council is a success, it can be an example for other countries."
316,Answer1,Vietnam has expressed an interest.
317,Answer1,All of the MRC staff are from the state.
