Interview 1 - Jenna Shinen.docx," Ms. Shinen explained that her views would be biased towards water, given that she is a member of the DOSs Water Team. With respect to water, she felt that the major challenges in the Mekong were the very rapid pace of development; hydropower development; and a lack of coordination. She also raised concern around the profusion of cooperation platforms in the region which, she said, are a hindrance to effective cooperation and coordination between the Mekong countries. Water issues are political issues as is natural resource management, typically decided at high level. There are major challenges all around natural resources management in the basin. These have, she argued, been politicised, and there is currently no real development path going forwards. As a consequence, Ms. Shinen felt that the introduction of a new cooperation mechanism was not the answer. She suggested that WB make a detailed investigation of existing mechanisms to see what does or does not work, and then use its leverage to strengthen or improve these. There is lack of coherent coordination between cooperative mechanisms. Stronger leadership is required, along with coordination from development partners (DPs), rather than creating a new platform. DOS, she said, monitors events in the Mekong through a political lens, looking for what they call conservation crimes. Actor consultation is also determined through a political lens. She summarised the DOSs engagement with a variety of international NGOs, including IUCN, WWF and Conservation International. ACMEC, the MRC and Friends of the Mekong and an ASEAN may be the best options and warrant further examination. "," What regional cooperation should be is for all of the regional countries to have an equitable seat at the table, and for the DPs to listen. As for opportunities, the MRC still seems to be the best weve got although having only four signatories is problematic. We were all excited when ACEMCs started, hoping that it would develop into something, but that doesnt seem to have happened. Vietnam (while ASEAN chair) made valiant efforts to have the Mekong made into an ASEAN priority. The Mekong is becoming the next South China Sea. Cooperation in the Mekong needs to be rules-based (unlike the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation LMC). Rules-based approaches need a sweet spot wherein there are sufficient benefits to be gained, but not so restrictive that no one will join. That is sufficient recourse to address unsustainable practices without constraining sovereign autonomy. Poorly designed incentives for basin cooperation also introduce risks of losing membership. Perhaps the Mekong Agreement needs to be re-opened that could be interesting, requiring donor support and political support. The benefits of regional cooperation, Ms. Shinen argued, out-weigh the benefits of bilateral cooperation. Emphasis on the lost opportunities (economic and social) without regional cooperation. "," ASEAN has examples, although not necessarily from the Mekong. Whatever the case, a cooperative platform needs to be home-grown and co-designed, even if it is economically-related. Ms. Shinen argued that for the Mekong countries, its pick your own favourite development partners and wait for the best offer. ASEAN has made progress on some fronts, although it has not necessarily been successful. There needs, in regional cooperation, to be some name and shame systems, which ASEAN has. The way things are going, we have to capitalise on the politicization of the Mekong to yield positive outcomes. DOS, for example, is looking for ways to obtain positive environmental outcomes despite what it sees as aggressive Chinese manoeuvring. The PRC makes a big show of being environmentally friendly and eventually, there will be a tipping point where they will have to be this. Reputational risk of non-action may be an important incentive. The DP community should be facilitating a path for them to achieve this. "," Aspirational cooperation needs to become economic. Laos, for example, needs to recognise that it would probably make more money from water management and tourism than from hydropower. The WB is trusted and very well situated to act as an information repository and bring other Institutions into the discussion. Because of this, it can bring in other institutions. The MRC doesnt have the incentive to develop trustworthy relations the member countries dont want to receive bad news from the MRC. Not does the MRC undertake economic analysis and is mot speaking to DPs and riparians of the economic benefits of regional cooperation. As for the MRC, Ms. Shinen said that she would like to see its Joint Committee empowered by both the member states and the DPs. "," Ms. Shinen was uncertain. Perhaps re-envisioning and empowering the MRC so that its recognised to have both power and value. Also, signs that environmental challenges are seen as a challenge by ASEAN. Anything that would show a rallying behind a home-grown mechanism. The MRCs biggest success is its survival. People are, Ms. Shinen argued, paying more attention to the MRC now than they were five years ago. The PNPCA has perhaps been their biggest success (although not everyone would agree). We need to do what we can to ensure that it continues to survive. Thailand and Laos need to see the MRC has value to them. The MRC is, however, good at making the case to DPs, and not as good at making the case to its own member countries. We need metrics for cooperation some kind of score card. But what would be considered useful metrics to the regions countries, and who are the keepers of those metrics? Perhaps a minimum threshold of cooperation could be established, beyond which the countries could seek to maximise economic benefits. Ms. Shinen would love to see the WB coordinating the DPs. If the MRC cannot or is unwilling to do this the WB is the next best thing. "," The best types of cooperation have a selfish element to them. Perhaps this has happened around ground water, in which cooperation intra- country seems to have been successful, but so with transboundary aquifers. Ms. Shinen noted that not al benefits are necessarily economic. Uniform approaches are unlikely to succeed: but tailored to capacities and needs. "," These days in the Mekong everyones sitting back waiting to see if theres a better offer down the road. The US-China tensions are preventing cooperation but also, perversely enabling it. WE shouldnt waste a good crisis. "," At the MRC, no one will speak before Thailand. Vietnam has plenty to say, but they wont say it unless theyre seriously riled. Thailand needs to take leadership in the region for real cooperation to occur. I sometimes see that they want to, but then only to be disappointed. The Thais are very smart they see that regional cooperation is in their own interest. Understanding self-interest and other behavior as the precursors/constraints of cooperation is important. Also, the messy behaviors in between. ", Economic Valuation (including non-market) is not the answer to balancing sustainable development with economic development. Value can just be traded around the place. There has to be some other way for this to happen,"Jenna Shinen,"," Senior Water Export,"," US Department of State,"
Interview 10 - Aymeric Roussel -kc.docx," The ecosystem and natural resources degradation. Deforestation has been very intense because of land concessions and illegal logging. This has contributed to climate change. Hydropower expansion is also a contributing factor. The latter is a strong concern for Cambodia, which has been heavily reliant on the Mekong for its fish. Also flash floods, reduced flood season affecting juvenile fish growth and periodic droughts. We also observe demographic growth and strong urbanisation trends . Mr. Roussel was uncertain if agriculture would remain important for Cambodia. How to reverse all of this ecosystem degradation is the key issue. "," Willingness to share vision, policy and capacity to make compromises and the capacity to make decisions for the region and not the nation recognising that deciding in favour of the region, may not favour your country. Subsidiarity at the right level as close as possible to the citizen level. These kinds of cooperation are necessary even obvious for the Mekong. Do we have effective water management cooperation? Are decisions made from a regional perspective or individual? That is a mosaic of individual interests rather than a coherent, common regional vision. In the Nile, negotiations have yielded a quota system for sharing proportions of the basins waters. Sovereignty is still very strong in the Mekong which constrains agreements like the Nile. The countries are willing to making compromises, but only small adjustments to their investments. The other countries do not try to prevent a large dam on the mainstream (using a right of veto which does not exist) even though there is evidence that it will harm them; and Laos makes modest changes to the dam in an effort to appease them. ASEAN is not really interested in water management. The MRC has a limited mandate that does not allow for a binding challenge to mainstream investments. It has not been able to challenge its member countries on investment projects. Will the LMC be the new mechanism? I do not have much insight into the LMC. Mr. Roussel would like to see accountability, and for civil society to be consulted. The LMC seems to be very driven by its leaders summit. And influenced by China and its investment in the region. This has implications for sustainable development it leads to growth in the short-term, but less sustainable development over the long-term. One special interest area is energy. Mr. Roussel wonders if there is any kind of regional energy framework? He recalled that the MRC wanted to promote regional energy cooperation, but Mr. Roussel has not seen any progress. Hydropower has been a major driver of regional investment. He has heard that there is much surplus energy from the Chinese dams this suggests that there is a need for regional energy cooperation and planning, with potential for a no dams option. The EU is at a pre-programme phase as it considers its future regional strategy, and regional energy cooperation might be part of this. "," Mr. Roussel has been in Cambodia for five years, and had previously been in Vietnam in the 1990s. Perhaps the MRCs Council Study is an example. It was a good initiative that took a long time. It is a pity that it seems to be a bit forgotten now. There has been minimal reflection and no influence on national decisions strategies. We do not see much reflection on how the study will impact the member countries; there are no strategies for addressing it. On the contrary Laos continues with business as usual. Last year, they announced several new mainstream dams. There has not been a positive outcome from this. The MRC has developed many interesting tools and a lot of knowledge. But less focus on what to do with it, and how it will assist sustainable development. For example, the Don Sahong. Cambodia resisted this dam because of its concerns for its fisheries, but then, when it was completed, started buying electricity from it. In Africa, the EU is investing in biodiversity conservation, and also critical watersheds. There is nothing like this here. Again, Mr. Roussel thinks, this is because of sovereignty. "," The MRC has a lot of knowledge, tools and expertise. But they have limited power or scope. Also, China is not a fully-fledged member of the MRC. This limits its effectiveness. The LMC is still very young. It is good to see that all of the Mekong countries are members, at the same level. The MRC also has a small voice in the LMC. At some stage, the Mekong countries may have to pick between them. The LMC covers many areas its very wide but how will things be implemented, and followed through, or the capacity created to do so. But it is not positive that the Water Cooperation Centre is based in Beijing, which is far away from the Mekong. If dont know if the development partners see opportunities with the LMC. It seems very closed. But maybe not to the World Bank. The LMI, the GMS, the Japan-Mekong Cooperation these are all donor-driven initiatives with different objectives and thematic agendas. We lack coherence in the region. There is a need to simplify the co-operation frameworks. But maybe the countries do not want this. "," If it looks at the real sustainable development not at short-term immediate growth. So too, the capacity to assess the impact of cooperation beyond the countries by themselves could be a real indicator. For example, transboundary EIA and CIA. And real processes for example, consultations with civil society. The MRC stakeholder consultation is a good first step. But accountability is missing to address, for example, civil society concerns. So too, engaging civil society might also be an indicator, not just the private sector. Consultation may be just a faade. Do we as the EU speak with one voice? Mr. Roussel asks rhetorically. We need to harmonise our vision across the development partners as well (including China). With a shared vision then cooperation and synergies can emerge. The increasing competition between China and the US is, perhaps, helping to foster simplification within and amongst the cooperation frameworks. It is essential that the needs that cooperation addresses are identified by the Mekong countries. "," The decision to share information and flow forecasts between China and the MRC is a good start. Otherwise, I dont really know. Mr. Roussel references the complaint that China is using its water for diplomatic reasons. This might be hampering effective cooperation. It would be good to have forecasts for Chinese water releases the MRC could introduce these into their modelling, and support decision-making. Managing sediments is also an issue, especially between China and Vietnam. Perhaps this is an area for cooperation; so, too, energy so it can be sent from places where surpluses are produced, to where there is demand. China and Cambodia have signed a free-trade agreement. This could contribute towards an increase in trade between China and all of the lower Mekong countries. It is important that Cambodian investors seize these opportunities it cannot be just China buying up more Cambodian land with few jobs and little revenue to Cambodia. "," When it comes to water management, the perception that each country owns (sovereign rights) its water is problem. Sovereignty is still very strong in the Mekong. Having a shared future is very important for cooperation. For example, hydropower is justified because it increases the competitiveness of the countries, which then increases, and they compare themselves to economic growth in the other countries. Differences in energy prices between the countries can also lead to inequitable development. Maybe also autocracy, so perhaps these sovereignty issues come from the top. Building trust could support cooperation between the countries, by getting people closer. Mr. Roussel references the EUs ERASMUS programme, that supports your people in exchanges to help them develop a common future. The private sector moves easily across borders perhaps there is a need for investment regulations. "," At the beginning, the country leaders they could choose what to cooperate with, and the degree to which they would cooperate. Now, the private sector plays a strong role. But were talking about sustainable development so, it is hard to balance the short-term with the long term. Chinese investment in Cambodia has created many jobs in the construction, casino and garment sectors. Because of conditions imposed by their markets, the garment factories have done well to apply social standards. This is not really the case with the construction and casino sectors. Mr. Roussel worries about mass tourism including artificial islands which might cause huge pressure on Cambodias coastal fisheries. All of these investments are short-term and for immediate profit. Cambodia is close to China and interested in being even closer; and China is keen to invest more in Cambodia. This might be an opportunity, but it remains to be seen how all of this investment can be regulated. "," Mr. Roussel thinks that the capacity needs to be developed to anticipate the long-term impact of investments, and a willingness to adjust plans and construction to make it more sustainable. This needs a mindset, and cannot just be box-ticking. We also need to focus on the quality of development consulting with local communities more, because they have a vested interest in sustainable development; they are dependent on the environment. He returns to the subject of mass tourism in Cambodia, pointing out the governments active promotion of it, and creation of policy to support it, and speculates as to whether or not this is the right strategy","Aymeric Roussel,"," Natural Resources Management and Rural Development Attach,"," EU Delegation to Cambodia,"
Interview 11 - USAID -kc.docx," USAID has a focus on transboundary environmental issues the challenges that cannot be addressed by one country alone. Unsustainable extraction and use of natural resources from across the region endangers economic growth. The need for individual countries to propel their own economic growth forwards may make sense at the individual country level but not regionally. Amongst the challenges that Ms. Hogg mentioned hydropower, forests, sand mining, and impacts on the flood pulse, unintended consequences and lack of shared management enabling equal opportunities for riparians to meet development objectives. USAID has also been looking at the potentials of low-head dams. We are concerned with a lot of the infrastructure they are not against it, but would want transparent data platforms that all stakeholders can access. She feels that the most complete data possible is needed, and regional spaces for where data can be shared. There needs to be, in particular, data-sharing between upstream and downstream countries. There is asymmetric information availability on floods and droughts. This puts individual countries at a disadvantage. There is insufficient inclusion of civil society in dialogues. They want their platforms to be available to civil society to understand and debate trade-offs as well as the private sector to address externalities, which can be very powerful. John Ward (Mekong Futures] asks a question about the capacity to analyse data beyond just data gathering. Ms. Hogg mentions SERVIR-Mekong as an example of USAID-supported initiatives in this respect. High quality data is needed, but she acknowledged that information-overload could also be a problem. The Mekong Infrastructure Tracker, an online platform (created by the USAID supported Mekong Safeguards Project) was introduced to stakeholders. She said that it can reveal the impacts of infrastructure, and can help countries to decide which infrastructure should be developed. Ms. Hogg described it as a planning tool. Ms. Hogg mentions that they have recently signed an agreement with WWF that will look to support civil society to access data, and use it to gain influence. "," Looking at challenges that need multi-country solutions. This can be done through a variety of fora networks, the private sector, different types of engagement or civil society. Many different platforms, Ms. Hogg feels, can be a good thing. There are many opportunities. She identified the MRC as one, the regions only treaty-based multilateral. They are exploring the possibility to strengthen regional institutions to allow them to better support their client countries and the purposes they were designed for. So too, drought is a crisis that is attracting much interest this too is an opportunity. There are also options to work with other DPs who share the same interests she mentions working with DFAT on the low-head dam initiative, and fish passage demonstration with Japan. The COVID crisis has revealed system weaknesses. There is an opportunity to rethink these systems, to create resilience, new institutions and value chains. John Ward [Mekong Futures] asks who identifies the challenges? The DPs, or the countries? Ms. Hogg replies that it depends on the initiative. The WWF initiative she mentioned earlier was based on consultations. Other institutions might have goals worthy of USAID support, and it seeks to deliver this to help them achieve their visions. But sometimes, they will support a specific issue proposed by an individual agency. "," The MRC work around flood management and forecasting to safeguard lives and property. This example is also one where a willingness to share information is revealed. Less controversial problems are ones where everyone agrees to share data. For example, resource rights, access and use. Ms. Hogg says that they are still working out how they should coordinate with other (US) partners on their Mekong-US Partnership. "," We see the merits of working with institutions that have been endorsed by their countries. These have advantages. The likelihood of longevity for these institutions, Ms. Hogg says, is higher. She sees a triangle of government, society and the private sector as being a necessary framing for activity. Externalities need to be brought into decision-making. She points out that for many of the countries, engagement is described in law, so they also look at how they can support these countries to follow through. Civil society and their contribution to development decisions is typically not endorsed by Governments: this need to be reconciled. "," We are grappling with this. USAID is very bilateral, so success tends to be measured very much at the country level and indicators are tangible. Success at the multilateral/regional level is a different thing and requires very different metrics. We want to see improved outcomes for citizens; inclusion; and well-managed resilient systems. Ms. Hogg wonders about the legal frameworks governing regional initiatives if individuals are to be held responsible (for infringements), at what point will regional law switch over to national law. Coming at problems from the top can provide cover for individual countries. At these levels, countries dont want to be standing alone. At regional levels, things are highly complex it all gets fuzzy. However, it does not have to be a I win and you lose situation. There is a win-win place. All governments care about is staying in power so they have to respond to their constituents [whoever they may be]. As such, undermining ones natural resources in the long-term has security implications. If you undermine your agricultural sector, that can spill into your political space. Long-term planning is necessary. John Ward [Mekong Futures] asks if trans boundary cooperation can be achieved by aggregating examples of bi-lateral cooperation? Ms. Hogg responds that we need to build bi-lateral relations but more for regional cooperation: high level fora can be a cover for individual nations: multilateral training sessions, however, can facilitate a chance for exposing commonalities and solidarity, which can spread upwards. Kim Geheb (Mekong Futures) brings up time horizons and the prisoners dilemma. A thought experiment: if two countries cooperate they can achieve 50% each of their objectives: but if one defaults they can achieve 100%. Trust is central to the decision. Ms. Hogg responded that these decisions undermine national security, especially economies tied to rain fed agricultural systems. It may be 100% but only for one year: 50% may be for 10 years meaning greater benefits over a longer time horizon. Incentives and political weighting that address longer time horizons may be effective. Political weighting is not always the same as those of external actors. Kim Geheb (Mekong Futures) remarks that there is a current emphasis on biophysical data, analysis and projections: less so on how reliant communities respond to change or collapse. Social and economic-livelihood dimensions often more compelling re national security. Ms. Hogg agrees that the socio-economics of the region is very important. She wants to see it pushed into the transboundary decision-making space: connecting biophysical changes with livelihood consequences. Understanding the motivations, beliefs and drivers of decisions is critical. What happens to livelihoods and nutritional security when the fisheries collapse? Studying these kinds of questions reveal the potential instability that unsustainable development might cause. Aligning (harmonising) laws and policy between sovereign states is important and a step towards transparency and consistent social safeguards. Ms. Hogg mentions indigenous people, and her concerns that governments do not treat them equally. And yet, the majority of natural resources in the region are managed and exploited by them. They are also the first exposed to impacts, and remain under-represented. "," Where the trade-off is not huge. Disaster risk reduction, maybe. Or issues where there is already a joint agreement in place or a common vision/objective. It is more difficult when it revolves around things that drive economic development. This takes more work to address. Where joint agreement has already occurred, this simplifies things. External co-actors (impartial observers?) may facilitate cooperation. "," If challenges are similarly perceived, this enables things. Jointly agreeing on what the problem is. If there is a shared understanding and an appreciation that it cannot be solved alone then cooperation is possible. It is not, however, that simple. While there may be common agreement on the problem, there might not be on the solution. "," Host countries, civil society, and there is a role for academia. The private sector is also an important actor. They can see that their supply chains are at risk if they do not address certain sustainability issues. Responsible businesses are a strong incentive for governments. If you want a more business-enabling environment, you need more transparency. Some businesses like agribusiness may have very long-term horizons, and are therefore keen to secure their supply chains. Stronger enforcement of national laws likely to harness to diversity of the private sector. "," A lot of what we are talking about is lining up to this. The countries are very dependent on their natural resources for their economic growth if the natural resource base collapses, so will their economies. Its about bringing this (latter) information into the equation. Often technical counterparts understand the ripple effects of development decisions but these are not translated into policy; a function of power asymmetry. Also, how do we elevate this knowledge into these conversations? Those who understand or hold it do not have a seat at the table where decisions are being made.

Interview 12 - Anders Imboden -kc.docx," Broadly, weak governance domestically. In Laos, weak rule of law, and an absent civil society. This weak governance means that investments take precedence over the law. Weak governance can play into the hands of many, but Mr. Imboden is thinking particularly about the PRC. "," The medium through which the countries work through is the national state. They drive decisions. Nevertheless, there is very little transparency. The MRC is the regions only treaty-based organisation. It is imperfect, but there is nevertheless transparency to how it works. This is an important opportunity. In thinking about opportunities, we have to ask, opportunities for whom? The MRC is accessible to all of its member countries and their people. Transparency is inextricably linked to accountability [so a focus on accountability is an opportunity]. "," The PNPCA, which Mr. Imboden feels is a positive process. But he referenced what he called the creative re-use of material produced for the Pak Beng by the Pak Lay proponents [this refers to the discovery by a regional NGO that the Pak Lay proponents had copied and pasted material from the documents submitted to the PNPCA by the Pak Beng developers]. This turned the spotlight on the developers. The media then also becomes important [to highlight the story]. Regarding the importance of the media, Mr. Imboden references a newspaper article that claimed that China Southern Power Grid (CPSG) was taking over the whole of the Lao electricity grid. The Lao government launched an unprecedented campaign to refute this. As a consequence, media is important, and the governments can also recognise this. "," He has already referenced the MRC and the LMC (to a lesser extent). ASEAN is a tough nut to crack. It is very consensus-driven. It also has high credibility, and so inherently useful. But Mr Imboden was not sure how this could be improved again. For Laos, ASEAN is very important for its engagement. It is important that China engages with its downstream neighbours. But the LMC opens the door for China to do other things, which Mr. Imboden considers malign. Returning to the tole of CSPG in Laos power grid, Mr. Imboden says that this is a problem because it involves a foreign government controlling what is strategic infrastructure. We have to worry about whose interests are being addresses under this arrangement. He also references Laos debt, and how this is a big concern for the US. "," The ability of people to play some sort of role in the management of the resources upon which they rely. We tend to think in terms of trajectories and moving along them. With every PNPCA, we are constantly concerned about any backslide. "," Hydropower is an example of a visceral and obvious problem, and the PNPCA has been an effective way of addressing it, Mr. Imboden feels. The dams affect so many things. "," Strong inclinations for non-interference in the Mekong countries. The inability to use regional platforms for shared decision-making arises from sovereignty. The uneven abilities of regional civil society to address their own government also affects cooperation. There are probably many shared concerns across regional CSOs. The consensus-driven thing is frustrating. But when consensus is obtained, then it is impressive. Laos cares a lot for the MRC, and sees it as important to its own credibility. We are seeing the impacts of climate change. Hopefully, this is a wake-up call, and we can also hope that it is seen as a shared concern. No one country can solve climate change by itself. There are those who say that the MRC legitimises decisions that have already been made. We look for opportunities to engage all the time. Outwardly, the Lao government is always saying positive things about the MRC which then gives us space to discuss things; given that we both share this perspective, this helps us. "," Whoevers behind any given project. It isnt just one party, but the PRC is behind a lot of it. China is absolutely influential, and Mr. Imboden sees the Chinese government working through the LMC. What is less clear is who the main actors are on the Mekong tributaries. They are cumulatively important. "," Lao depends on natural resources; and it is mainly agrarian and its people mainly subsistence farmers. Sustainable development must be achieved. Laos is reportedly a communist nation, which represents an immense opportunity. It would be nice to see civil society involved as well. Laos is an interesting laboratory in which to pursue sustainable development because here, everyone is supposedly on the same page (because the country is communist). In the Lao debt crisis, it is the creditors who hold all the cards and they are the party. China, Mr. Imboden says, never attend the development partners roundtable meetings. Laos keeps things bilateral with China, and keeps the relationship very insulated. Were trying to be good friends, but in the end, its their call, right","Anders Imboden,"," Development Assistance Coordinator USAID Laos Country Office,"," October 21,"
Interview 13 - Asia Foundation -kc.docx," Mr. Parks: There is a lot of geo-political competition, which provides the opportunity to connect with a wide range of multilateral partners. But it also forces countries to make choices that they might not have otherwise. There are also large transparency challenges. In water governance, transparency has been a challenge. Differences between countries. In Laos, the rule of law is weak, so water is vulnerable to capture by internal and external elites. Thailand is keen to be a regional player even trying to shape safeguards in Laos. Mr. Zawacki: he agrees with Mr. Parks. Geopolitics overlay a variety of technical sustainable development issues. He adds, servicing, navigating and negotiating the 13 frameworks is a challenge to sustainable development. It takes great time and energy to do this, and if sustainable development were to emerge from this, it would be happenstance. The water levels on the Mekong (whatever their cause) have been a huge challenge to sustainable development. Mr. Zawacki also identifies the on-going disconnect between government and civil society. These two sets of actors do not speak the same language, and do not agree on what sustainable development is, let alone what sustainable is or even development. At government-to-government levels, there seems to be agreement on what sustainable development is; the same is true amongst very diverse NGOs and CSOs. But these are two different parallel tracks, with no connection. There is no common SD lexicon and distrust. Governments look more at economic factors, while CSOs/NGOs more at the environment. Mr. Parks: points out that all of the regions countries have to report on the SDGs. "," Mr. Parks: there are five small- to medium-sized countries in the lower Mekong, and they need to cooperate with China to manage the rivers ecosystems. Cooperation is a way for them to address this challenge. In terms of opportunities, there are already many efforts. Each mechanism has its own focus; most are driven by external actors, and offers opportunities in, for example, health or education. But when it comes to water governance, the governments will not be able develop collective action by giving up sovereign control over their water resources. Mr. Zawacki: of the 13 frameworks, three deal with water. Most of the frameworks deal with the Greater Mekong Sub-region as an economic geography. The MRC and the LMC together are not necessarily the best combination for water governance. Indigenous ideas need to come forward. Mr. Parks: points out many of these frameworks are run by diplomats this disincentivises saying no to them, and possibly reducing their number and diversity. Mr. Zawacki: the ministries of foreign affairs are dependent on (so-called) announcibles. Sustainable development is mal-apportioned there is little investment in smaller (but highly relevant) technical ministries. Sustainable development is only small ring of the development onion. Laos is the only country that is a member of all 13 frameworks. Myanmar has chosen not to join the MRC, perhaps because they see greatest benefit in remaining an observer. Its a lot harder to break commitments once youre in them than to make them. He doesnt think that there will be any attrition (i.e. a reduction in the number of regional frameworks) because, for many countries, they would see that withdrawing would be seen as a geopolitical mistake. For Laos, being a member of so many frameworks is considered essential for its credibility. There is cultural propensity to not say no: and countries will join these frameworks to diversify partnerships even if they are viewed as tokenism. There is distrust between Vietnam and Thailand re water and energy and to a lesser extent Thai-Cambodia. "," Mr. Parks: obviously, the MRC. But outside of the MRC, he is not sure. There may be some examples we do not know about. Mr. Zawacki: there is the example of Thailand deciding (unilaterally) to not go forward with the Mekong Channel Improvement project (and blasting rapids to allow for deeper draft vessels). Thailand said that was because of local resistance; but China was probably not happy about this. Nevertheless, China portrayed it as an example of it listening (and acquiescing) to its partners needs. "," Mr. Zawacki: some are better than others. The LMC, we should remember, has done a lot. It pledges and then delivers. It has done more in five years than the MRC has done in 25. The more successful frameworks tend to be the ones with greater focus. The ACMECS 2019 Master Plan has so many demands - a shopping list. The countries do not know what they are getting by contributing to it. Mr. Parks: we are comparing apples and oranges. The frameworks are all very different. ACMECS is just an idea and there is no activity. It is a receptacle for DPs and useful only for gaining a political perspective. The Mekong Japan framework is the most transparent. The LMC is mostly platitudes and press releases. "," Mr. Parks: ideally, an improvement in development outcomes especially for natural resources; and countries abiding by their agreements. But you have to recognise that what a diplomat sees as success will differ from what a development person will see it. For developers, development is a means to broader cooperation. Mr. Zawacki: just completing projects could be seen as successful. But is it really successful, and for whom? It always comes back to definitions. It is important to remember that, for officials, they see success; they see that livelihoods have been improved. NOTE THAT AT THIS JUNCTURE, MR PARKS LEFT THE INTERVIEW. THE INTERVIEW WAS COMPLETED BY MR. ZAWACKI. "," The biggest overlap between the 13 frameworks is infrastructure connectivity. The number of roads, dams, rails has multiplied exponentially. This doesnt really happen without cooperation. You can, of course, point at the transboundary problems that result as a consequence of this cooperation, but this is besides the point. "," The absence of trust is the main variable affecting cooperation. Geopolitical factors tend to hinder this, depending on circumstances. The number of frameworks introduces death by meetings. The countries are six shades of authoritarianism. This should imply that the potential for trust exists, but that does not turn out to be the case because of border problems, historical reasons or whatever. What Is a priority for one country (e.g. the Tonle Sap) is not a priority for another (Thailand, who have power supremacy). Trust is the ability to rely on what has been said without necessarily having to follow up and verify. And the level of trust depends on the problem and the consequences. Intention is also a critical factor of trust. "," Governments but who within these governments. There is variation between people, departments and ministries. This is even true when funding comes from outside. It is rare to see people on the ground as influential. Mr. Zawacki remarks that his analysis of the current Thai protests suggests that the latter will not result in change because they dont have the numbers. "," The silver bullet is to conflate the sustainable development of natural resources with the economic development. The two cannot be mutually exclusive.

Interview 14 - Laurent Umans - kc.docx," At the broad level, the need to link politics, policies and projects. Geopolitics have become apparent. There have always been competing claims and interests on the river and its basin. In any future World Bank endeavour, the relations between policies (across governance levels), politics and projects will need to appear. For example, the relation between energy policy and final hydropower projects; or biodiversity policies and eventual nature conservation projects. There is a two-way link between plans, projects and policy. Projects should be purposively designed to strengthen policy. Dr Umans lists a variety of technical challenges: climate change, land subsidence in the delta, sediments, etc. These need to feed into policies and into the field of power relations. He then refers to what he calls an abstract challenge. Many of those involved in sustainable development are growth (quantity) and extraction-oriented, and focus less on the quality of growth. He thinks a slightly different discourse is needed, in which the river is seen as a living being, and has living rights. Its tributaries could be seen as the arms of this being. Dr Umans feels that this resonates with European history, and that of indigenous people. The river has its own heart (the flood pulse), and it creates and nourishes life. He hopes that this narrative can nourish policy including that of international development. Indigenous insights are complementary to our expert approaches and it is important to not just stick to this expert narrative. Mekong Vision 3.0 should be able to accommodate these other perspectives. "," Coordination is not just about committees. It is the outcome of practices that enable cooperation to happen. We tend to focus on the inputs to coordination, and not to its output. Coordinated action is where actors work together to determine common goals for the common good. It is not always clear what the advantages are to working at the regional level; or how the latter links to the national level. So, we must link to what is seen as the regional character of the river. Regionalism is now stuck to national borders. We cannot, at the moment, really talk about the the region because there is no regional identity. It might, Dr Umans remarks, be better to have a transboundary rather than regional focus. The people are the entry point into regional identity. You often see initiatives that contribute to regional identity, but then the states will need to play a key role in the creation of any supra-national entity to engage and be willing to engage in and create a regional perspective that then guides national (independent) activity. In Asia, this has a lot to do with their non-interference principles. The OECD countries are more willing to intervene in the form of cooperation and compromise national sovereignty. Kim Geheb [Mekong Futures] asks Dr Umans about the so-called Mekong Spirit. He replies that he has not seen many cases where the national position has been given up for the common good. He references Elinor Ostrom, and the importance of her work to the formation of institutions for the greater common good. There have been lots of interventions in the name of non-intervention. The MRC has a lot of potential for promoting action for the common good. "," The PNPCA is very clear, and the member countries are very active in this process. It is an example of an institution that has the acceptance of everyone. But then, transboundary EIA strategy has not been agreed upon within the MRC. Maybe water diplomacy is less visible in the MRC. Dr. Umans says he looks forward to a strengthening of water diplomacy units. He says that this should not just be housed in regional ministries of natural resources and environment; there is a lot of scope for ministries of foreign affairs to be involved, and supported by the MRC which it has a mandate for. Water diplomacy is also important for the regions geopolitics. The last user in a river should be happy with the quantity and quality of the water received. "," Dr Umans says that he is only really familiar with the MRC. The opportunities here, he says, are the same as those for cooperation and coordination. Perhaps the World Bank can point out that it is counter-productive. That the US, Japan and Korea all have their separate initiatives. The river is not just a living being, but also a social body people and societies interact with the river. We in international development should also be operating (supporting) as a collective being giving up institutional identity for the collective good. "," The outcomes of coordinated action and practice. For example, on the financial side. Every country has its own practices of financial management. If cooperation happens, then you will see changes in these practises and a co-evolution of institutions towards financial management ends. "," Maybe it all started with flooding, which was seen as a problem decades ago. Technical problems have been effectively tackled. Institutional problem has been mediated by the MRC such as the procedures with spin offs to leverage implementation. Water diplomacy has not been effective. So too, uptake of the MRCs Council Study has not been effective (measured as degree of uptake). Dr Umans is also concerned about the link between a highly effective MRC secretariat with less-than-effective government agencies. That the member states are willing to 100% fund the MRC by 2030 is a clear indication of cooperation success. He refers to Vietnamese staff being cycled through the MRC Secretariat, and then returning to their home-based government positions, and that this has resulted in positive changes within these ministries. "," The traditional relationship between China and Vietnam prevents cooperation. This is not really a deep trust relationship. The difference in capacity also prevents cooperation for example, relatively high capabilities in Vietnam, as compared to Cambodia or Vietnam. Highest level political commitment is an enabler. It helps, Dr Umans argues, that most of the regional prime ministers are all from communist parties. While other Vietnamese agencies might be reluctant to engage with China, their respective communist parties have formed a bridge. He sees the parties as being the most trusting agencies in the two countries. The idea of IWRM has enabled developers and academics to work together under a broad frame. The non-party relationship between China and Vietnam is very distrusting. He considers three fault lines in the relationship: (a) their common border; (b) the East Sea; and, finally, (c) the Mekong. The latter has, Dr Umans says been cooking over the past 1-2 years. Because of the similarities between the two countries, however, there is a basis for cooperation. Dr Umans does not think that the Red River is such an issue between China and Vietnam, in part because the Chinese dams have prevented flooding in Hanoi. The way China uses this river has been more complementarity with Vietnams needs. "," I tend to think the party. The government does what the party prescribes. The extent to which the party is involved in the Delta (for example) is a bit of a question for me, however, and the importance of the Mekong is uncertain. Academics in Vietnam are influential. This emerges from their Confucian heritage. The careers of civil servants are determined by the merit that they acquire, which is based on their capacity to mobilise science for their jobs. Science is the basis for the state to make decisions. The private sector construction companies can leverage their financial (employment) power to leverage government decisions and may also be important actors. International actors are still present as influential actors, but that influence has been diminishing. "," There are different ways, but they depend on how natural resources are valued. Different calculations will be more conducive to bringing about this balance. Natural resources are more than just resources. This implies that they are useful to us, and touches on their intrinsic value. The Netherlands, Dr Umans mentions, has a Water as Leverage programme","Dr Laurent Umans,"," First Secretary,"," Water Management and Climate Change,"
Interview 15 - Christian Engler - kc.docx," Mr Engler explains that he has only been in Laos for a year. National interests come first. This is a challenge to managing the basin as a whole. There are lots of meetings, but perhaps not to the point of respecting nor honouring obligations. Data-sharing the MRC struggles to get data from its member countries, including Lancang flow data. There are lots of frameworks, but very few have any legally-binding aspects. Inclusion of civil society and the private sector is also a challenge. Management of the rivers water is a challenge, and Mr Engler cites water quality, waste water disposal, pesticides and so on. While the latter is not such a problem at the moment, he thinks it will become a major problem. A new aspect is groundwater data, analysis and management. More research is needed on this. The Mekongs tributaries have not been systematically monitored. Dams are also a challenge. Switzerland has been involved in dam safety, and has detected problems with maintenance, reporting and monitoring of dam safety issues. There are no systematic analysis of the findings and contingency plans for when a dam breaks. This is a big problem in Laos, and the private sector needs to be more engaged and held to higher standards. The causes of the lower Mekong low river levels remains frunknown and uncertain. Common standards across the countries are needed, including the private sector, and should be legally-binding. Mr. Engler also mentioned that there is no cross-border framework for managing navigation. "," The regional approach can address critical opportunities in a more neutral setting. For example, issues that cannot be addressed at national levels can be addressed in MRC or ASEAN settings. Difficult problems such as civil rights or community resettlement. This is because of peer pressure at these high levels. He had thought, however, that ASEAN would have more convening power than it does. The Mekong is a transboundary area it is best managed, and treated, as such. Working with different governments has identified a number of entry points and opportunities for DP cooperation, joint funding and support. Mr Engler mentioned HIV in southern Africa, where homosexuality and child marriage could not be discussed nationally but standards agreed in multi-lateral fora. These standards then translate to national policy. This approach could apply to civil rights and resettlement in the Mekong. In the Mekong issues addressed nationally cannot be discussed multi-laterally. Peer pressure and reputation play an important role. "," He identifies an MRC-China research project on mainstream flows, partnering with IWMI. Research can be a good entry point floods and droughts for example have more of a scientific flavour and are considered less contentious as a result. He mentions another research initiative with IOM on migration, from which results are now emerging. He confesses to not understanding regional reluctances to share data with their neighbours. "," Thailand and Vietnam are very active in the MRC. He feels that the current set-up is good, with a strong secretariat. They have quite clear strategic goals, and a two-year workplan. He feels that the MRC works well. ASEAN, he comments, was not created to manage the Mekong, and is focussed more on maritime disputes. The Mekong basin touches a lot of people, and should, as a consequence, have more strategic value. There is very little data or information about the LMC and as a result difficult to understand intentions and strategies. It seems, Mr Engler says, the LMC operates in parallel to the MRC. Switzerland, he says, encourages engagement between the MRC and LMC. Mr Engler was uncertain of what improvements might be needed; suffice to say, it would require political will. "," Measurable facts such as fish, sediments, etc. If this is the case, then cooperation is easy. It would be a success if data were available, and trends within it positive. If the MRC countries agree to minimum standards, and one country blocks this, then this cannot be a success. All countries need to agree and implement min standards. He wants to see high-level agreements acted upon at the country level. He thinks that it is good to have hydropower scrutinised by the countries through the PNPCA process, but it does have to be more than just a box-ticking exercise. Civil society needs a more active involvement in the PNPCA. ", Low water and flooding are where cooperation seems to have worked best. The next challenge will be cascade dam management. ," The first one is national interest. Also, there is not enough transparency. He references too secretive Concession Agreements (CAs). Sometimes, not even national ministries know what is in them. Also, groups within the nations are a challenge, by which he means investor groups and rent-seekers. These could be foreign or provincial groups, or the families through which mining, land and forestry concessions, etc. happen. Who gets what for what and why? This is amplified at the regional level. Related to transparency, he mentions that Laos declined to share the results of the dam safety review with any of the other MRC member countries. The inclusion of stakeholders at all levels down to the community level - would be an enabler. "," The political levels the higher the more influence, within the government and the party. The second influence group are those with both a foot in government, and another in investment such as the families or consortia. They can influence national cooperation with other states. If we are looking at cooperation for sustainable development, then the INGOs are another actor. He mentions how Oxfam gave voice to local groups at the MRC. But the biggest influencer is China. The LMC emerged from China, and it has its own path. Thailand, he says, is the second biggest influencer in the region. Laos followed exactly Thailands response to COVID. Currently, Thailand has the chair of the MRC Joint Committee. They know what they want and how to achieve those objectives. Mr Engler was unclear how DPs could strengthen cooperation. "," You can only sustain economic development if you sustain your natural resources. The whole green economy approach has merit. Because of is large biodiversity, water and forest resources, Laos has a unique opportunity in this respect","Christian Engler,"," Deputy Regional Director and Head of the Agriculture and Food Security Domain,"," Swiss Development Cooperation (Vientiane),"
Interview 16 - Jake Brunner.docx," This is a pretty good place to live. The rate of (economic) growth has been high and steady. What made sense politically and economically 25 years ago has now changed. The quality of growth is a concern. In the Mekong Delta, Vietnam has abandoned the third rice crop, which is good. Their recent agreement with the EU will introduce new standards to manufacturing and food safety. Covid could expose the reliance on national exports and national budgets. Countries could be In Thailand, growth is lower, and they have an ageing population. Mr Brunner feels that higher quality growth and compliant FDI is being sought regionally, and that this is very positive. Many problems remain, nevertheless. "," Future SD margins (of growth) will depend on cooperation. At higher levels, it is possible to see cooperation, but not so much at lower ones. The magnitude of trade between the Mekong countries is fairly low as compared to that with external markets. There are many opportunities in energy cooperation. If you focus only on water, it tends to be a zero-sum game; but if you add in other factors, such as fisheries or sediments, then opportunities for reciprocity merge. He mentions an IUCN-supported initiative to have a national park, Hin Nam Na (primarily in Lao PDR), is in the process of World Heritage Site declaration, which requires both Vietnamese and Lao PDR endorsement. "," The Lancang dam cascade has, Mr Brunner says, made Lao run-of-river (ROR) dams viable. I dont know if there was a specific plan for this. The new operation of the cascade, however, presents a grimmer picture and existential threat for the Tonle Saps fisheries, for example. On the Lancang, there is a very large difference between expected flows and observed ones. It shows the dams are holding back very large quantities of wet-season contributions to the Mekong. He argues that this is because of a new high-voltage line from Yunnan to Guangzhou, which means that the hydropower companies are looking to withhold water to take advantage of higher dry-season cost per unit electricity. China, he says, has never really rebutted this argument. In their response to the Eyes on Earth Report, Tsinghua University argues that lower wet season and higher dry season flows were a good thing for downstream flood control and management. The MRCs five procedures are good transboundary outputs they are not, he stresses, outcomes. The exclusion of the tributaries is an important omission. There are lots of outputs, but Mr Brunner cannot think of any outcomes. "," The MRC, the IUCN says, is a vital organisation, but severely limited. Five years ago, IUCN did a study that showed a huge difference between the MRC and the Convention on International Water Courses which, Mr Brunner felt, is the gold standard for river basin organisations. The MRC, he said, should be reformed. There are those that argue that revisiting the 1995 Agreement will cause everything to unravel; but this risk can, he said, be managed. If this is not done, he said, the MRC stands to die a slow death. The MRC is the only legal framework in the region not even the LMC or BRI. There is huge interest in the Mekong Region. When the new Japanese prime minister took office, the first foreign country he visited was Vietnam. China, he says, sees the Mekong as the second front by which to isolate Vietnam. The primary Chinese interest in Lao PDR and Cambodia is economic, although they also have political concerns. The Mekong is a good place to do business. For the US, the interest is mainly political it sees Chinas moves into the Mekong as unacceptable expansionism. Vietnam is the political and economic outlier. Anti-Chinese sentiments are not as evident in Thailand. "," When it comes to successes, he references the Lao PDR Prime Ministers 2016 decree to clamp down on illegal logging. This has a huge (positive) impact, although some illegal logging remains. He also feels that last weeks agreement to increase Lao electricity exports to Vietnam from 500 MW to 5,000 is an example of successful cooperation. He talks about the IFC recommendation to keep the Sekong mainstream free of dams as positive and funding the southern Lao-Vietnam backbone grid. There is, he says, a fine line between success and failure of HP projects and operation that can be quantified. This could show the degrees of cooperation and compliance success. There has not been systematic energy planning and cooperation in the region. Comprehensive evaluation of alternative energy planning strategies, including env impacts is an important step (e.g. y% of exports with x% of impacts). If that happened, we could all sleep better at night. The jury is still out, Mr Brunner says, as to whether or not the LMC wants real cooperation. China does not want to be constrained by legal agreements. They want to maintain their margin of manoeuvre whether through debt, water or electricity. They see ambiguity as advantageous. For Mr. Brunner, real cooperation would include things such as China discussing their hydropower development plans with Laos; or perhaps revealing when they would be making releases from their dams, and jointly modelling the impacts of this. But there is no forum for this the Eyes on Earth study shed light on this, and was embarrassing all round. But may have provoked China to release real time water flow data. Critical information to allow downstream countries to plan and adapt for flow conditions. As economies become integrated, surrendering some sovereignty yields benefits over the long-term. The ability to do this is, in some senses, a sign of political maturity. Obviously, when it comes to the 1995 Agreement, the countries did not want to surrender sovereignty. Now, however, Vietnam really does want to see this (surrender of some sovereignty). The other game-changer Mr. Brunner believes, is the southern Lao backbone grid. "," There is a growing amount of cross-border trade. Perhaps the most successful cooperation has been in telecommunications. There has been very little cooperation on natural resources. But external pressure can force countries to be better citizens. He provides the example of the EU issuing a red card to Vietnam because of their illegal fishing in the Gulf of Thailand and subsequent yellow card for seafood exports. Cross border FDI (from Thailand) has meant lower growth for Thailand but less externalities and pollution in Thailand. Laos, he says, seems sincere in its commitment to a green economy. In the Vietnamese data, the government has fundamentally changed course. The light touch embodied by the 1995 Agreement, he says, is no longer relevant. For the MRC, he says, all energy is hydropower which means that it does not promote a focus on alternatives. Additional cooperation can yield significant environmental and economic benefits. "," Note: Mr Brunner had another appointment to go to, so the online verbal interview was terminated once Question 6 had been responded to. The remaining responses were provided by Mr Brunner in writing. The countries are still wary of cooperation. Nor is there a venue other than MRC for the MRC members to discuss broader planning and investment opportunities. Fundamentally, theres lack of trust. One of the reasons Vietnam has been reluctant to rely on Lao or Cambodia (let alone China) for electricity imports is that they simply dont trust their neighbors to honour their contracts. So, lots of formal meetings between ministers and heads of government levels but very little cooperation at lower levels. But I think thats changing. Cambodia is now importing power from Don Sahong and a future coal power station via the LS2 transmission line to Phnom Penh. Vietnam is increasing power imports from Lao. One barrier to cooperation is that planning is done sector by sector, which limits the scope to capitalise on mutual benefits by considering multiple sectors at same time. We discussed the case of Lao needing Vietnamese support to implement Decision 15. "," China is obviously the #1 investor although its suffered reputation damage with its manipulation of the Lancang to maximise profits from the dam cascade. Western countries could be much more influential in their cooperation on development policy and financing. That seems to be happening with formal cooperation between US and Japan. A paradox is why hasnt Vietnam, the most vulnerable country to upstream development, been more vocal in advocating non-hydro renewables and power trade as a way to reduce risks to the delta. One reason is that within the Vietnamese government there are different constituencies, which seem to cancel each other, leading to policy paralysis. MOITs failure to come with a coherent power plan led to the intervention of the CPV, which issued Resolution 55 in February 2020 that marked a decisive move into solar, wind, and environmentally friendly alternatives. "," I would frame the question differently: How can government deliver broad-based economic growth and social security at minimum environmental risk? I like Ziv et als definition in the context of dams and fisheries: Although socioeconomic progress is desirable, sustainable development requires that unnecessary risks to ecosystems and environmental services, such as fish production and biodiversity, be avoided. The good news is that with new technologies and greater transboundary cooperation, the tradeoffs are increasingly less painful","Jake Brunner,"," Head,"," IUCN Indo-Burma Group (Hanoi),"
Interview 17 - Pech Sokhem -kc.docx," Six countries with six different sets of interests and motivations. There is even diversity within the countries between sectors, for example. In addition, there is a super power at the top of the (Mekong) system, and Vietnam, at the bottom of the system, is an emerging power. The region has a history of conflict and war. The most recent the Vietnam/China dispute). There has been a polarisation of the various platforms. The creation of the MRC, Dr Pech feels, was a reflection of the Cold War (viz the 1957 Mekong Committee), which was why (in his mind) China and Myanmar were excluded from its membership. Hence, there is a real lower Mekong focus, which serves to exclude China. All information and unilateral development in the lower Mekong is now coming from China. The World Bank and ADB are trying to catch up, but China and its investment banks are a more attractive source of financing. Private and national investment banks enable short cuts for development, with less stringent safeguards (or poorly defined standards for EIAs or SIAs). How, Dr Pech wonders, can we ensure that all the various cooperation frameworks apply the same rules? There is a lack of unity in the application of rules, or information-sharing. The victims of all of this lack of coordination are the poor. "," Regionalism or multilateralism is very relevant. COVID is causing regional isolationism to protect national interests. Even during the American War, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand still managed to talk. The construction of Laos Nam Ngum (1) dam emerged out of this dialogue. Regional cooperation now falls under all the various frameworks, which remain important to helping the countries understand each other. Talking is important as a start (to cooperation). Talking without action is also a problem, but you have to start somewhere: to to share views and to listen to each other. Dr Pech wondered if the delegation that represents Cambodia at the MRC actually represents the country given how fractured it is. There has to be a harmonisation of the countrys position, he argues. A stronger or better process is needed, and real good father discussion is required. Coordination is the biggest challenge in Cambodia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs coordinates at the highest level, with the technical ministries playing lesser roles. Each ministry has its own perspective, he says. Before the meetings, they will try to hammer out a national position, and then the head of delegation will do all the talking. But the other problems is that the people change all the time, so that there are different people for different meetings [which might not mean much if there is a strong national position, but does matter when there is not]. It is difficult to ensure consistency. In Cambodia, the LMC is coordinated by MOFA, the MRC by MOWRAM, and the GMS by the Ministry of Planning. These different objectives do not translate as a coherent national position. So, we need to explore a stronger unification of position within the countries. But, Dr Pech wonders, do they actually want to harmonise amongst themselves? The same situation of fractured applies to DPs: USAID, World Bank, ADB for example. When Dr Pech was the Director of the Technical Services Division at the MRC, they had signed an MOU with China to share data, and there was great celebration. But nothing happened then. Since then, there has been only slow movement. The LMC sees the MRC as a legitimate body, Dr Pech says. There has been a change in attitude amongst those who push the process in Beijing and Yunnan. But progress on data sharing is still disappointing. Even within the most downstream of the countries [Vietnam] there is inconsistency. Between, for example, the relatively anti-dam position of MONRE versus the pro-dam perspective taken by the Ministry of Energy [actually, the Ministry of Industry and Trade]. In the MRC, a strategy for transboundary ESIAs has been on the table for 20 years. The MRC has data, but it is incomplete for example, fisheries. But it is still better than nothing. The MRC belongs to its four member countries, so if they want it to play a larger role, they have to create it. "," The MRC in particular, shared data and capacity building. It is through the MRC that the next generation of water professionals is passing. The MRC is a platform for discussion. They should, however, have done more to addressing the unfairness of one country benefitting more from the development of its natural resources at the peril of other countries. "," There are always opportunities. While there are merits to them, I see problems with the proliferation in all of these cooperative frameworks. Each has its own alliances and goals, which just leads to a zero-sum game. All of the shared destiny stuff is rhetorical and overly optimistic. This needed to be translated into reality, and requires better coordination. ASEAN has a stronger and bigger convening power (than the MRC) but is dominated by non-Mekong countries (Dr Pech mentions Singapore and Malaysia). It is the differences between and within countries that needs to be addressed. John Ward (Mekong Futures) says that there is very little evidence of evidence-based policy-making. He wonders if all of this data and research is therefore of relevance. Perhaps we need to understand the politics more. Dr Pech responds that the knowledge base is fragmented, which is a problem. Knowledge management needs to focus on appreciating the knowledge, and how it informs decisions. It is more the culture and political economy, which tends to be self-interested. The relationship between knowledge managers and policy makers is always a challenge. The knowledge base stated with the 1957 Mekong Committee, with a focus on basin development, hydropower and irrigation. Much of that initial knowledge base disappeared with the relocation of the MRCs. Improved data management is necessary, especially quality data that can inform policy. "," Workshops and meetings (joke). How has the decision been made? How have the needs of vulnerable groups been addressed? And how has it all been translated into action? These are the kinds of questions that need responding to if we are to assess whether or not cooperation has been successful. We need a more robust M&E system. For some, its all about whether or not the funds have been expended or disbursed such as for the World Bank. In addition, we would also want to know if alternatives have been considered? "," Capacity-building seems the most effective. But transboundary water governance is more than capacity-building alone. Dr Pech cites the example of transboundary EIAs, which, he says, the countries consider to be a political hot potato. So, then they delegate to technical issues. How long has it taken for the MRC to publish its hydrological year book? So, even with technical data, it can be complicated. As a consequence, we sometimes have to use incomplete data, which just uses up more money, more time and more frustration. Meetings can also be very useful, and Dr Pech feels that the pandemic may have taught us the benefits of online meetings. In-person meetings use up a lot of budget and there are alternate motivations for attendance (DSA as supplementary income, shopping, airline points). We need a good mix between in-person and online meetings. "," A lack of understanding and suspicion prevents cooperation. While Vietnam has been chairing ASEAN, they have wanted the Mekong to be prioritised. People then think theres some kind of hidden agenda. Everyone thinks that China has a hidden agenda with a history of mis-trust. Confidence and trust-building enable cooperation. But we never achieve it. Real political will and stronger leadership is needed. Development partners are still playing this role, providing financial support and a little bit of dictating and figuring out what roles the countries should play. If you want to weaponise the Mekong, you wont get cooperation. Geo-politics in the Mekong has become much more complicated because of the Cold War between China and the US and other regional points of tension. We have become hostage to the super powers. "," China and theres no doubt. It has tremendous influence in Laos and Cambodia. Vietnam has a more complicated relationship with China. It tries to show that China is not influential, but you look at the volume of trade between China and Vietnam, and that makes China influential. For Laos, the countries that buy its electricity are influential. Also, SOEs, investment banks, and private investors from Russia and elsewhere. The ADB and World Bank are no longer as influential as they used to be. Now, a road can be constructed in Cambodia in two to three months by cutting corners. It used to take much longer. The development of the Mekong today is decided in Washington, Beijing or Manila. CSOs are also influential but not as influential as these other actors (above). This is because of their capacity, and the political systems in the Mekong countries that prevent them from operating. Mekong Vision 3.0 needs to level the playing field for these more vulnerable actors. "," The countries promise to achieve the SDGs by 2030. But how to achieve the proper balance is very difficult. I dont think Cambodia wants to achieve middle-income status on the one hand, and the SDGs on the other. All of the previous epidemics have been because of forest clearance. Covid is not the first epidemic, nor will it be the last. In New Delhi, they can now see the sky and the stars because of the lockdown. So, we need to use this COVID-19 opportunity to move towards carbon-neutral countries by 2050. The emphasis is still on economic development, without consideration of rural households and preserving/conserving forests and soils. As natural resource degradation continues, increased health care costs and social disruption will make achieving SD more difficult. It is very complicated, but now is the time for us to consider a carbon neutral future","Dr Pech Sokhem,"," Director,"," Cambodian Development Research Institute,"
Interview 18 - IWMI -kc.docx," Dr Sellamuttu: Climate change and related aspects are taking on a bigger emphasis, especially in the preparation for the COP-21 meeting. Linked to this is the CGIARs Two-Degree Initiative, that will focus on mega-deltas, including the Mekongs. Dr Pavlic: Regional work on water insecurity, and a better understanding of drought. Dr McCartney: Climate change intensifies challenges and risks for flood and drought, the impacts of land use change (mentions land concessions), river (sand) mining, and governance, and how these challenges will be managed. Governance issues are complicated by vested interests and the fact that the basin is shared by six countries. "," Dr Sellamuttu: Bringing together the different actors government, civil society, private sector, and with knowledge brokers such as the CGIAR playing a role. Dr Pavlic: Our view, as researchers, is to provide impartial knowledge to the debate. Dr McCartney: For starters, countries working together to find solutions. Ideally, it would be in an optimal or integrated way to address these challenges. The MRC is an attempt to do this; while the LMC is new and starting afresh. The process should be science-led, Dr McCartney feels. It is not the only facet, but an important one. The MRC is trying to generate evidence-based decisions. Governments at least pay lip-service to evidence-based decision-making. There is, he feels, greater recognition that droughts and floods are impacting development. One would hope that the place of evidence in decision-making will increase in the future. Dr Sellamuttu: It is not that simple. We have to take into account the political economy this can push decision-s-makers into places where they do not take into account evidence because it does not fit into their narratives. Dr Pavlic: It is very complicated. We expect immediate responses, but it does not happen that way. Ground water was floated as a challenge in the 1970s and 80s, but nothing was done about it until the 2000s. The Lao governments response to the banana problem in its north (Chinese-owned concessions, over use of pesticides, non-payment for Lao labour), however, is an example where a government did respond quickly to the evidence. Responding to questioning from John Ward (Mekong Futures) on whether or not the government is responding to a clear objective and an acute problem. Dr Pavlic agreed. The problem was identifying suitable alternative options for banana farmers. Dr Sellamuttu: In Myanmar (where she is based) that the Advisor Group of the National Water Resources Committee displays a sense of wanting to engage in the Mekong. They seem interested in the lessons of collaboration, and applying these to the Irrawaddy. Dr McCartney: Research findings will not be taken up by the government just because it is good research. Working through the CPWF and WLE has taught us importance of boundary partners and impact pathways. Their fora were an attempt to get people talking together researchers need to do more to exchange their messages. It also needs to recognised that it is opportunistic researchers need to recognise and seize opportunities as and when they emerge. Dr Pavlic: It is important to try and understand policy-makers, and to respond to their needs. We need to get onto the right foot. Dr Sellamuttu: Theories of change geared towards specific actors. Really tracking from the outset specific individuals who you are targeting for change. She mentions most significant change stories as a way of tracking change. The sustainability of changes also needs to be followed up. "," Dr Sellamuttu: It is important to look at how lessons are learned, and the cross-fertilisation of these. And, after the project is finished, to return to the site to see if some of its outcomes still remain. Dr Sellamuttu references the MRCs SIMVA project, which seems to have been effective cooperation, even if it was knowledge gathering. Dr Pavlic: There are lots of groundwater examples. Worked by the CCOP and by MRC on capacity building meetings to share experience. There are very limited cooperation opportunities around groundwater. Dr McCartney: There are many activities that to a small extent contribute to cooperation. He mentions the IUCNs (BRIDGE) 3S project lots of meetings and discussions in pursuit of transboundary water cooperation, but he is not sure if it was lasting. He also references the Xayaburi, and how it resulted in a redesign following the MRCs PNPCA process. Perhaps the latter is an example of compromise through cooperation. He also cites China releasing water during the dry season or drought as an example. "," Dr Sellamuttu: There are merits to each. For example, the MRC has its dialogue mechanisms, while the LMC has theirs. She also recalls the (WLE-implemented) Mekong Forum on Water, Food and Energy which, she says was a different type. It would be useful, she feels, to move from the policy dialogue aspect to the more technical connecting better research-for-development with policy and decision-making processes. This could be an area of improvement. Dr McCartney: The MRC has been a valuable attempt, although always hindered by some of the binaries involved. The LMC is perhaps a more valuable attempt to bring all of the Mekong countries together. This needs to be linked with investment. The ADB would do well to link into some of these platforms. The link to money and investment is essential. "," Dr Sellamuttu: This depends on the indicators, and perhaps some of the other unplanned things that happen along the way that contribute to it. Indicators might refer to the numbers of people moved out of poverty. Dr McCartney: Sharing data and information. This is an indicator that countries are engaged together in decision-making processes. The MRC is an attempt to balance sovereign rights. There are processes within it, but do the countries really share data? Many MRC processes get bogged down in bureaucracy, and countries taking months and months to do anything. Perhaps another indication of success is if decisions taken are non-contested after they have been made. "," Dr Pavlic: Where everyone stands to benefit; when there are losers, then things tend to break down for example, when upstream users impact downstream ones. Dr McCartney: tangible benefits, such as hydropower. This may be a sufficient trade-offs because they get the benefit of power, even if the dam affects them. Countries will always make decisions in their national interest. Laos might hypothetically not build a dam if it improves its relations in the region. So, there are tangible and intangible benefits. "," Dr Sellamuttu: The main problem that prevents cooperation is the different political agendas. For example, the differences between up- and downstream countries. Also, national priorities can be problematic. Situations where theres political will to take advantage of win-win opportunities is a key enabler. Dr Pavlic: Not all Mekong countries are equal, and all are different. China, at the top of the basin, has a very loud voice. National interest is there in the Mekong countries, but they also need to trade. This glues countries together. There are, it should be remembered, things that link the countries together beyond just water. Dr McCartney: Common interests and commonly perceived problems drive cooperation. Perhaps climate change will drive cooperation because they need to work together to resolve it. It often comes down to money, and whether or not they feel that they will be better off working together than alone. "," Dr Sellamuttu: Those connected to the highest economic gain economic growth and development. For example, the energy sector is a more influential sector than the environment, fisheries of agriculture. Thailand and Vietnam exert influence over Lao PDR and Cambodia because of their economic development. Dr McCartney: Different countries have different capacities to influence development. You would have thought that the upstream countries have the most power. But economic power introduces some interesting dynamics. "," Dr Sellamuttu: The countries are trying to embed and mainstream the environment into the sectors that have stronger bargaining power trying to show that the environment is valuable. She references the SDGs, and wonders how SDG 15 [Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss] links with the other SDGs. Dr Pavlic: Scientific advice needs to be heeded. Also, balancing short-term benefits with long-term gains. Dr McCartney: You cannot have your economic development without your natural resource base. It isnt a dilemma these things are the same. He thinks that the need to manage water more sustainably is coming. Science needs to make the case that economic development is not in conflict with sustainable economic development","Drs Sonali Sellamuttu,"," Paul Pavlic and Matthew McCartney,"," Senior Researchers,"
Interview 19 - Suon Seng -kc.docx," Whoever the public sees as benefitting the most from the Mekong. So far, it has been state to state. But sustainability is not just the government. We have to combine the micro (households and communities) with the macro (national level). "," When we see that regional cooperation is cross-country and bilateral. But regional cooperation needs non-state actors, both within and across borders. Cooperation means collaboration between state and non-state. For the state to engage with the non-state is an opportunity, and draw them all in to the development of strategies. But they have different interests. Governments see cooperation as macro-benefits, not the micro. We might then forget the small village suffering from drought. "," So far, information on the flows. Since the 1995 Agreement, there have been two to three results. The first is conflict avoidance around the Mekongs waters. While we (in the countries) do not always agree, we have a platform. Second, information-sharing, both data, but also the concerns of different stakeholders. Third, consensus around the use of the river. Hydropower, for example: some people see it as good, some not so much. For me, it is good that we continue (discussing). We cannot expect Lao hydropower to share the benefits with Cambodia. The Mekong is common property, but there are boundaries. Each country has the right to use its own water resources for transboundary cooperation, for example. But there is still much to be done. "," The 1995 Agreement gives too much to the state role. There need to be additional voices, such as those of academia, so as to bring knowledge into reach. There is not equal cooperation in the MRC. Mr Suon wants to see more roles for CBOs. It is hard for them (the CBOs) to find a way to collaborate. They are, he says, always under the NGO. How can farmers in the different countries understand one another? He sees collaboration as scale, first at the ground level, then moving up to think tanks, and then up to the governments. Now, the private sector is moving into this collaborative structure, but, he says, they cannot compromise on the loss of benefits. Governments see the private sector as creating jobs. There is free thinking in regional universities, that lies outside of the MRC. We cannot rely on the MRC to criticise itself. Within the MRC, we see a lot of compromise between state and state. Academics can dig deeper (and be more inclusive?). He describes a presentation he once delivered in Kunming looking at small-scale irrigation. But it was explained to him that this was too small-scale. He talks about how Cambodia designates different sizes of irrigation schemes, which do not even include the lowest (village) levels. But the micro is where farmers work and invest, and this is where irrigation works best. "," There needs to be both qualitative and qualitative indicators. Amongst the qualitative are when we see less complaining amongst the people; and when the people are willing to share more information. When they do not share, then we know that they are not happy. Also, more consensus while it might not be complete, everyone can agree. As for quantitative, this would include things like the number of people affected by disasters, or economic improvements. "," People see more the disaster, more than the benefit. And one disaster is not enough there has to be a series before there is collaboration. The Mekong is natural, so we cannot complain when the disaster is manmade. Early warning is something, but it is not enough. Development should include mitigation, and these plans presented to the public. Kim Geheb [Mekong Futures] asks what the difference is between collaboration and cooperation. Mr Suon replies that cooperation is more about strategic design, while collaboration is more about in hand work. "," The benefits and burdens of collaboration combines with levels of thinking or knowledge. Mr Suon considered the mercurial property rights around the Mekong. The water is, he says, a public resource, while the land on its banks is common property. Water is common property only within sovereign borders, but not across borders. So are fish. If fish migrate from Cambodia to Lao are they Cambodian or Lao fish? This is why the Mekong countries continue to have a problem. The level of understanding is a barrier. This can be can be improved to include socio-cultural interests. "," The governments, if we look at this from the formal perspective. They have the final decision. Knowledgeable individuals can be influential, but not much. Influence is when the people see it for themselves, and not because of someone else. An authority can order people to do things, while an influencer can get action through discussion. Reputation, respect are important attributes of an effective influencer-facilitator. China is playing the game all around. The MRC can bring the countries together to talk to China. China is a big country and is upstream. One country cannot talk to China alone. At the same time, if China wants to collaborate with the Mekong countries, it must also work with the MRC. If the lower Mekong countries do not collaborate with each other, then China will approach them individually and favour individual countries. "," We see economic indicators as a measure of success which then prioritises economic development. If we used natural resources indicators, we could give more weight to them. In the Cambodian National Social Economic Development Plan, there are 130 indicators. Most are economic variables, or ones measuring the spread of infrastructure. Why do natural resources have less weight? Because people understand that these are needed for economic development. One way people think is that if we are going to do development, then we have to leave out conservation. But others feel that natural resources conservation will provide economic development","Suon Seng,"," Director,"," Center for Development-Oriented Research (Cambodia),"
Interview 2 - Hirose and Suenaga.docx," Mr Hirose: There are two key challenges. First, regional stability for development; and the rule of law, and respect for human rights. Second, quality economic growth. In the Tokyo strategy, quality growth focusses of connectivity and sustainable growth. The Tokyo Strategy is an initiative of the Japanese MOFA, with consultation with other Japanese ministries, and in consultation with Mekong country ministries. Mr Suenaga: The Tokyo Strategy does not include China. Insofar as the Mekong River is concerned, the strategy calls for a green Mekong and addresses pollution, water management and climate change. "," Mr Hirose: There are many schemes here, for example, the LMC and ACMECs. There is a need for cooperating with these, and their coordination. Over the past ten years, Japan has invested over 600 billion Yen in the region, and the Mekong countries have expressed their gratitude for this. We want to continue contributing. Mr Suenaga: the main aim of Japans cooperation is for all Mekong countries to optimise their national development strategies and to improve livelihoods. Each year, Japan holds two high level development meetings. After every meeting, no schemes emerge. Each scheme is completely independent, and reflects whatever the proposing country thinks that they are skilled at. For Japan, it is environmental management. "," Mr Hirose: I do not know of any examples. Mr Suenaga: The MRC is a successful example, but it represents only four of the Mekong countries. "," Mr Hirose: we have many schemes and many barriers. There is high interest in the region, from countries, the private sector and NGOs. Each stakeholder never knows the whole picture. We need to meet together to discuss, so that we can all see the bigger picture. Mr Suenaga: Each country has an advantage, which they pursue. If all of these schemes were integrated, coordination would become very difficult. "," Mr Hirose: This question is difficult to answer. It is important to gather the opinions from the various stakeholders. But meeting together can be difficult. And after every meeting, new schemes emerge. Mr Suenaga: There are no indicators in Japan-Mekong cooperation. Maybe we can defer to the planned outputs and outcomes identified in the MRCs annual working plans. At present, Japan mainly provides bilateral support. Each project has a purpose, but not specific indicators of progress. "," Mr Hirose: Hard efforts such as hard connectivity, which is building infrastructure. But it is not all hard. We also train recipients how to use and manage this infrastructure. And then there is soft efforts such as other types of training, or creating circumstances suitable for Japanese investment. Mr Suenaga: Japan sees its work in climate change as being part of risk reduction for its recipient countries. This is important for the Mekong countries, given recent drought and flooding. Japan provides assistance towards this through the MRC. At last years G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan committed to supporting marine plastics reduction, and towards water pollution control. For Japanese companies, the Mekong Region is very important it is both geographically and culturally close to Japan. One country here, however, does not offer sufficient protections for the private sector. The Japanese government is working to reduce risk for its companies. "," Mr Hirose: There are so many schemes here. This prevents cooperation. For Laos, their development of large infrastructure must reflect the governments budget. They dont consider this. Sometimes this makes the problem bigger than it was before. We need quality development with not so much large-scale infrastructure that increases Lao PDR government debt. Mr Suenaga: Lack of information-sharing. Not enough information from some of the upper countries, so then the lower countries cannot make decisions because of lack of information. This also affects the MRC. "," Mr Hirose: China a big actor. China has the budget and a lot of huge projects in Lao PDR, such as the railways and the expressway. The budget is also very huge, and the number of projects is also very huge. We need to talk with them to discover their intentions. He hopes that Japan is a trusted partner. He thinks that Japan has a good relationship with each of the Mekong countries. Mr Suenaga: The individual countries should be the most influential actors (parity in influence and decision making?). This is his hope. "," Mr Hirose: The four pillars of the Tokyo Strategy are an effective way to balance sustainable and economic development. Especially the strategy of hard and soft efforts. The realization of the green Mekong approach is another such as disaster risk reduction, water management, and the sustainable development of aquatic resources. Mr Suenaga: It is important that each government has effective development strategies. For example, in Laos the government is considering its next National development plan, and prioritises green growth including Mekong water resources. Cooperation with the public sector, and civil society is also very important. Mr Suenaga [in response to Shelleys question about the Tokyo Strategy, pointing out that it was issued in 2018, and wondering if theres been any adjustment to it in light of COVID]: the Tokyo Strategy provides Japan with direction, which will not fundamentally change despite COVID. Mr Hirose [in response to Shelleys question regarding Japans engagement with China]: we try to communicate with their embassy but cannot get the exact information. We need to communicate our bi-lateral plans. Japanese and Chinese private sectors need to cooperate","Messrs.

Interview 20 - Doungkham Singhanouvong -kc.docx," There has been a lot of change in terms of the environment. Especially water levels these are at their lowest ever. This may be because of climate change or other human interventions. There has been a lot of development in China and up-country (in Laos). Mr Douangkham is uncertain if the water levels have dropped because of the latter, or because of climate change. "," Cooperation can be many things. One thing we can do right away is information-sharing, be this data or experience. As for opportunities, we can talk together in both formal and informal ways, to discuss problems, and to learn from each other at workshops or exchange visits. "," Over the past four years, the MRC has supported the lower Mekong countries to learn about transboundary water resources management. Especially between Laos and Thailand. Mr Douangkham references a project in Bokeo (Province, Lao PDR) that looks at how we can manage our shared resources. Mr Douangkham thought it important to establish a group to work on a master plan to manage water resources from provincial, district and local levels so that they can manage their natural resources by themselves. In Bokeo, the local authorities would have liked to continue this project, but the MRC ran out of funding. Mr. Douangkham references a wide variety of challenges pollution, sand mining, etc that affect fisheries habitats. The water is shared, so if two countries cannot agree on tools or guidelines, then it cannot be managed. As for fisheries, he feels that there has been good cooperation between the countries. He has worked with the MRC on fisheries research since 1997. The MRC has enabled very good cooperation between the countries. They have held various fora, so that people from other countries, experts and many stakeholders can get to know each other and to share information. ASEAN also convenes things, but he has never attended one of these events. They (LARReC) use the MRC fish database, as well as contributing to it as the supervising data collection in Laos. "," So far, he does not think that there is so much difference between the mechanisms. They all give the same attention to sustaining the environment. In the future, Mr Douangkham looks forward to more fora to make us work more closely together and identify solutions. "," Cooperation can occur at any time. Under the LMC, we have started to have good cooperation. Again, he references exchange visits and information-sharing. Now, we can talk with Myanmar face-to-face discussions. This indicates success. He also sees visits and meetings at different levels happening. For LARReC, the focus is mainly on science cooperation. He recently sent staff to China on an exchange to learn how to do fisheries research. The Chinese are willing to support LARReC. He is now working on a fish passage project (led by the National University of Laos and Charles Sturt University) supported by ACIAR. The project looks at how fish can move upstream, which is a problem with all the water infrastructure. When it comes to getting eggs back downstream we still do not have this kind of technology. The project is focused on getting fish up. ", Hard to say. The countries need to look at the benefits. Upstream countries might hold back water so as to generate electricity; or they release too much water during the wet season and not worrying about the downstream countries. , Mr Douangkham does not see anything to prevent cooperation. Maybe funding that is why we need World Bank support. ," This depends on the level. At the high level, it can be the president or the prime minister. Or authorities at lower levels. This cooperation is mainly the responsibility of the MRC. Mostly, Mr Douangkham thinks, the government will listen to their (LARReCs) recommendations. It might not be 100%, but mostly. Now we would like to include fish passage into the fisheries law. This will focus on fish passage for agricultural infrastructure, and not for hydropower this is not our mandate; that is MEMs responsibility. They (LARReC) are working closely with the Department of Irrigation for this. "," This is quite a political question. If we look at the governments vision, we see that Laos wants economic growth because we are still the poorest country in Asia. That is not to say that the government ignores the environment but we look at the economy first. Our natural resources are nearly destroyed, so we see that we need to preserve it. We talk about sustainability for everything, including in agriculture and aquaculture. We go step by step our people need more income. It is hard to say that we need to protect natural resources when this is the case. Sustainable development is very nice, but in practice, it is very hard. The government does its best to achieve it. Everyone globally agrees that we have to achieve it","Douangkham Singhanouvong,"," Director,"," Living Aquatic Resources Research Center (Lao PDR),"
Interview 21 - DFAT -kc.docx," Ms. Mann: This is tricky. Some of the frameworks have a geography in the basin, some more focused on the relations between the countries that share it. The impact of the pandemic on the six countries, and its knock-on impacts to the economy and ecologies. She talks about a new Australian initiative called Partnerships for Recovery that responds to the pandemic, and development assistance that pivots and responds to the pandemic. The initiative responds to three key challenges: health, stability and economic recovery, especially for the vulnerable and urban job losses. Covid has amplified existing challenges, and creates new risks to value chains and food supply. Dr Dore: Value, health and governance are in steep decline. Pre-Covid, there were other sustainability issues. He mentions that the Mekongs tributaries are more than just a series of gauging stations. These issues are, however, just one slice of the larger SDG set. The Council Study, MRC BDP and the Mekong Delta are some initiatives to examine an expanded set of sustainable development issues. The SDGs guide sustainable development: is the focus just on water, whole of the basin or all SDGs? "," Dr Dore: there are very serious political challenges to sustainable development. Is cooperation the best phrase to use? Increasing regionalism is only Track 1. Not all of it is inherently good, or more important than bilateralism. While it is not new, but getting more attention now, perhaps because of geopolitical heat. All of the regionalisms and frameworks come from different places. DFAT has been updating its knowledge or, and revisiting the different regionalisms, objectives and their motivations (referencing The Asia Foundations Mekong Policy Dialogues initiative that DFAT supports). We have a broad view of regionalism, and it is not all Track 1 for example, cooperation within the knowledge community and NGOs. Of course, there are opponents to these perspectives. Ms. Mann: Australia sees the importance of transparency and inclusion in regional cooperation. They see ASEAN as a key element of the regional architecture. Dr Dore: Wants to know if Mekong Vision 3.0 will only be focusing on Track 1. Shelley MacMillan (World Bank) responds by asking where DFAT focusses. Dr Dore replies that it is in the public record that DFAT has for years provided low-key support to the NGO sector, and the knowledge community such as the WLE and MPOWER. We have been resourcing many different regionalisms across the Mekong. There are many different actors in the water-food-energy space. It has been beneficial to Mekong citizens to learn from each other, and not just from the MRC. Ms. Mann: Australia is also working with ACMECS. Dr. Dore: Yes, we agree that cooperation is very important for the sustainable development of the Mekong. But there are other pathways that can take you there (or not). Marcus Wishart (World Bank): The modalities of the World Bank mean that that they do not have the discretion to respond to these other (non-state) actors. Dr. Dore: There are different groups that can come together with different goals. The SAWI was cited as an example of Track 2 support. People come to issues from different viewpoints and orientations, and using different approaches. They dont seem to come at problems by different perceived problems: that is an absence of commonly perceived problems. NOTE: DR. DORE THE MEETING LEFT FOR ANOTHER MEETING AT THIS JUNCTURE. "," Ms. Mann: Explains that she is new to her position. Nevertheless, she mentions the design change to the Xayaburi emerging from the PNPCA process. "," Ms. Mann: The advantage of the MRC is its convening power, and how it consults and agrees upon developments. The advantage is that it works across countries and their political engagements. As for opportunities, one is the greater strengthening of a broader range of views in the PNPCA or guidelines. Nit: The MRC is more about peace-building, and a knowledge hub. Some actors will prioritise the environment, and are then seen by others as anti-development. We need to understand the complex web of benefits, costs and agendas. ", Ms. Mann: Cooperation has occurred around the PNPCA. This is an example of success. It represents change in the ways to mitigate impacts and strengthen the benefits. But there are a range of pressures and factors that may have contributed towards the latter outcome. She also mentions supporting civil society to engage with government to change policy to take into account a wider range of views. Year-round data sharing of river flows (LMC to MRC) is recent indicator. ," Nit: It depends on how certain actors see a problem and how powerful that actor is. If China sees it as a problem, they then channel resources in that direction. Ms. Mann: Wonders if there has been such a proliferation of cooperation frameworks because of different actors coming at a problem in different ways. Nit: Framing a problem in such a way as to come at it in a different way is very difficult. The Lao Government has 18 different ministries, and it is hard to get them all into a place where they all feel that they are getting the same benefits, as well as exposed to the same costs. Problem perceptions are a function of power (e.g. the China-Lao railway and Lao Hydropower). "," Ms. Mann: Different levels of trust prevent cooperation. And different competing priorities, capacities, transparency and understandings of the problem. Nit: Multiple different sources provide enablers. For example, the US-China trade war is not an enabler per se but can contribute to cooperation. Controversy (e.g. geo-political) can initiate cooperation. Ms. Mann: besides the reverse of what she said earlier, she mentions transparency as being an enabler; as is the agreement of different actors to work on a problem. But then a certain level of trust is needed. "," Ms. Mann: Governments, and the sovereignty of decision-making within their borders. But then, the regional architecture MRC, ASEAN and the private sector has a level of influence. This varies between and within countries. Kim Geheb (Mekong Futures) asks who in the private sector she considers influential. The different financial institutions (World Bank and national investment banks) that support large infrastructure, Ms. Man replies. Funding is subject to different social, economic and environmental standards. There are different policy areas within which they operate and, through these, they influence sustainable development. Also, infrastructure developers and their level of engagement and the relationships that they have with other actors. "," Ms. Mann: All governments globally are asking this question. Balance is definitely the right word each government will come at this from a different perspective, and whatever balance means to their countries. Nit: The how is the difficult part of this question. People want to take short-cuts, theres corruption, and a lack of long-term vision. Everything is a part in a big engine with lots of moving pieces. Ms. Mann: COVID will influence how that balance can be achieved, how government approach it, as will the different stresses placed upon their economies. She thinks that it will amplify the tensions between economic growth and ecologies. Nit: Financiers adhering to higher standards is one way. John Ward (Mekong Futures) asks about corruption, and if it is a type of cooperation (collusion), and if it is on the dark side of cooperation. Nit agrees, but also says that those who do not like corruption will not engage with it.

Interview 22 - Lu Xing -kc.docx," The primary challenge is scarcity, which is increasing. In the past there was so much water. This is not the case now. In southwest China, rainfall has reduced by 20%. So, competition for water resources is increasing. The second challenge is the Mekongs flows. So, it is a question of both volume and distribution. There has been huge development in the Mekong Delta. You need to assess how whole changes in the economy create new types of impact. In turn, this changes the nature and the magnitude of the demand for water. On the Tonle Sap, there has been big changes to the governance system as well by transferring 35 previous private sector fishing lots to 500 community managed lots. The private sector lots may have been more economically efficient, but distribution was not fair. The Mekong now has a regulated flow. It is no longer natural flow. This then has impacts in other ecosystems, such as wetlands. The primary driver of all these changes is market forces. He says that we (scholars) have not given much attention to what he calls the invisible user which is the agricultural sector. This uses 80% of water use in the Mekong. The second main driver is hydropower. In national policies, economic development is the priority rather than conservation. What, Prof. Lu wonders, do we mean by reasonable use in international rivers? When there is plenty of water (water is viewed as a freely accessible resource), this does not matter, but when there is scarcity, water needs to be valued. Water rights are demarcated via treaties as substitute. India and Pakistan is an example: where dam agreements are in place, seasonal flows agreed and there is a monitoring system. "," Cooperation occurs when water is a key part of the inter-state business on international rivers. Prof. Lu also feels that it is important to have scholars voices included in an advisory role. In the Mekong, sovereignty is very strong. States respond to internal pressure, and they have to think about their own societies. In Thailand, for example, civil society resistance has prevented development. The MRC can do little other than facilitate discussions around the 3S (an international basin) for example. Can six countries discuss water allocation? And can they use water reasonably? I do not think so. Water can be used far more efficiently, but it is not because it remains perceived as (and is) free. Water saving technologies for example is almost absent. "," So far, the MRC: at least for the four lower Mekong countries, have a platform. If the countries want to use the river, then they have a platform and a process by which they can discuss this. The LMCs agreement to share water is very big progress. The LMC has also been active in capacity building for droughts and flooding. Prof. Lu hopes that we will have more collaboration around the Mekong. The Chinese government, he says, has shifted in a positive direction. But he would like to see it go further, to assessing reasonable use and then on to equitable use. Kim Geheb (Mekong Futures) asks what the difference is between collaboration and cooperation. Prof. Lu responds that collaboration involves building the same principle; it is the equal way the principle of how to do things. "," The primary mechanism is the LMC because it includes water in its core business. For the other frameworks, water is not their core business. They only become aware of water if it is affected by their activities. Water is also central to the MRC. "," There are different indicators that can reveal success: collaboration, information-sharing, expressing concerns to each other, and using water fairly and equitably. Also, if water is being used wisely at multiple levels, from the local to the national. Cooperation needs to be evaluated in the real world. "," Prof. Lu focuses on pollution management, which, he says, is a concern that all of the countries have. In China, there are very strict pollution controls. Pollution is not a controversial issue, because, he says, it is very clear who is responsible. He references the response by local government in Laos to pollution arising from banana plantations. He also thinks that the reasonable use of water is a non-controversial challenge, although he acknowledges that there is no consistency in how people and countries perceive reasonable use. He also believes that there is regional recognition of increasing demand for water. John Ward (Mekong Futures) says that there are projections that water pollution will increase across the Mekong, and asks if Prof. Lu believes that existing cooperation mechanisms can cope with this? Prof. Lu says that they cannot they are good at monitoring and detection, but not resolving it. Prof. Lu cited the example of how the management of pollution in Dali lake has changed, using participatory based nature friendly remediation. May be a case study for other countries. "," Cooperation is prevented by a lack of states understanding of each others concerns. Often, it gets too political and needs to be de-politicized. And do those at the table really understand the Mekong? Prof. Lu does not think so. He feels that regional-national interests need to be looked at, and feels that (we) scholars can look at this to help improve understanding to create a more enabling, mutually-understanding, space within and between countries. There is also impunity for countries when they export external costs. "," This depends on the issue and at what time it is addressed. Prof. Lu identifies the international community as a primary influencer, and argues that their meetings and discussions can be a way to air concerns and to share information. As a second important influencer, ministries in the individual countries, but, again, it depends on the issue ministries of energy are influential in the energy sector; ministries of environment in the environmental sector, etc. Do not under-estimate civil society, Prof. Lu cautions, as well as scientists although the latter groups are, he feels, often invisible. Public opinion is also very important, but he is not sure that it results in decisions. He agrees (in response to a comment from Kim Geheb) that the market forces he mentioned earlier are also influential. Market forces, he says, respond to and address social needs. The media can also shape public opinion. Agriculture is the no. 1 influencer, followed by hydropower. Domestic water use is often a matter of survival: life and death. "," In just five years, China has changed the orientation of the state toward the environment not just at the Party levels, but up and down the countrys governance structure. He references the work he is doing on Dali Lake in Yunnan, where the local governments response to the lakes environmental problems has been robust. To obtain sustainability, we need an ideology followed by policies, and then technique. We must not see environmental protection only as a cost, but that it also has benefits that are not mutually exclusive of economic development. There are institutional costs associated with this and communities need support","Prof. LU Xing,"," Director,"," GMS Study Center,"
Interview 23 - Kanokwan Monorom -kc.docx," Several challenges: (a) unequal relations between up- and downstream countries. By upstream Prof. Monorom references China. Economically, there are huge gaps between them. It is in this gap that the big countries are making decisions about Mekong issues, particularly hydropower. (b) In theory civil society and non-state actors are supposed to be engaged by their respective government, but in practice, this process is not meaningful. There is not much space for local knowledge. (c) Marginalised people never know what is going on for example, why the water levels are low, or why the flows change so rapidly and substantially, or why there have been such drastic fisheries reductions. There seems to be no communication between up and downstream countries (particularly with respect to water releases), and in particular, no communication between the upstream government and the downstream communities. (d) Science is not a basis for decision-making in the Mekong. "," Cooperation is collaborative benefit-sharing. There must be some arrangement for multiple stakeholders (both state and non-state) to manage the rivers waters. When it comes to opportunities, we have to ask who these are opportunities for? For institutions? For academics? For everyone? Cooperation means everyone has equal opportunity to express their views and suggest alternatives. Benefit-sharing is also about cost-sharing, and managing both of these in a cooperative framework. IWRM is one example of a framework that tries to capture these points. "," The Mekong countries have been trying to cooperate for benefit-sharing for many years, but only at the top level at the diplomatic level. Not at the bottom levels. This is why it has not been successful. Benefit sharing has been a diplomatic process not a technical one. Civil society is always asking why they do not know anything? They want to know who is in charge, and they feel unrecognised and left behind. In all of the Mekong countries, it is the same and not just in Thailand. Cooperation is only talked about at the top level people at the bottom level do not even know what the Mekong countries are; they do not know what the LMC is. The governments do not carry the voices of these people to the top-level meetings. The Thai National Mekong Committee never comes to talk with them. If the World Bank wants to do Mekong Vision 3.0, this will be a key challenge for them. There are 25 river basins in Thailand, and each has a river basin committee. These are chaired by the provincial governor, and 80% of members are officials: these are not devolved enough. Sustainable development is important because nobody understands what it means. . Sometimes, International Rivers may be invited to these meetings, but never domestic CSOs. In Thailand, the River Basin committees never go far enough down. The communities with whom she works have never heard about these committees. "," They need more stakeholder participation. If there are lots of platforms to enable this, it would be good. Different platforms have different goals and mechanisms with which to achieve sustainability. Maybe we need to reconceptualise what sustainable development is. Sustainability is very contested. For local people, they feel that it is about sustaining their lives, the right to use their natural resources, and the right to manage these (including the Mekong). For the government, sustainability is the SDGs, which they employ at the planning level (eg national development plans), and not at the practical level. They (the government) use very fancy words to explain sustainability that it is managing resources so they can be used by the next generation. There is a huge gap between (sustainability) theory and practice, and the World Bank needs to realise this. The definition of poverty is also contested here, they also used fancy words, like multi-dimensional poverty. These are not neutral terms. Who defines them? Who benefits? Sustainable development is important because nobody understands what it means. Cooperation is also a very good word its very promising, and looks very compromising (by which Prof. Kanokwan means, suggestive of compromise). For me, cooperation means equal opportunity to cooperate why should people not be allowed to say what they need to? What is Mekong cooperation anyway and at what level? "," We should look at outcomes long-term impact. For example, if we have downstream villagers who have the opportunity to be informed and consulted when water is released from upstream dams, this is an output. But if this process also results in a mechanism to cope with these impacts, then this is an outcome. "," Cooperation can be effective if there are agreements in place such as navigation, compared to sustainable hydropower, where the guidelines remain contested and have been released. Cooperation can be successful if the institutional arrangement is in line with the agreement. Prof. Kanokwan references Thailands ambitions to divert water from the Mekong mainstream for its Kong-Loei-Chi-Mun project. But, she says, they have to ask the other Mekong countries for permission (this is not technically correct. They have to inform the other countries, but none of the latter can prevent Thailand from going ahead with the project). This project is Thai national interest, rather than thinking about how the downstream countries might be affected. The national plans for the individual countries are a big problem for Mekong cooperation it is because of these that they will never fully cooperate. Different national development objectives and plans do not consider effects at a deeper level (i.e. basin level). This is the main impediment and obstruction to cooperation. "," The first issue preventing cooperation relates to legitimacy. If you are eligible to cooperate, then you are allowed to talk. The trouble is, who decides who is legitimate in this process? The second is national laws each country has different laws with which to regulate the Mekong. The third is whether or not governments recognise the rights of their people as provided for in their constitutions if this is recognised, cooperation can be successful. Prof. Kanokwan discussed transboundary ESIAs, and thinks that these could be a mechanism for participation if so, then they can enable cooperation. "," At the 2018 Greater Mekong Forum on Water and Food, Prof. Kanokwan attended a session being led by representatives from the LMCs Water Cooperation Centre. It led her to realise that the most influential person in Mekong basin cooperation is whoever drafts their cooperation agreements. Cooperation is real for those who have the right to speak about it, but not for people in tiny communities. "," This wont happen they are parallel paradigms that will not, at some point, meet. If they are to meet, then they should be looking at accounting for the micro-scale this would be an alternative way of managing the Mekong. Another possibility is to incorporate social responsibility in the private sector. A third is a focus on what Prof. Kanokwan calls the informal economic sector which references peoples natural resources collection (subsistence production). It is with this economy that those who depend on the Mekong engage. We need to bring this onto the table, so that they can continue to rely on the Mekong. This needs to be discussed in a very serious way. John Ward (Mekong Futures) poses a question about gender, and that Prof. Kanokwan is the first interviewee to have raised this. Women have very limited opportunities to participate in Mekong decision making, she says","Assist. Prof. Kanokwan Monorom,"," Director,"," Greater Mekong Sub-region Social Research Center,"
Interview 24 - Ren Peng -kc.docx," Mr Ren has participated in previous World Bank consultations and leads an NGO based in Beijing, focused on Sotheast Asia and the Lancang-Mekong basin. The geo-political debate is the most important issue, followed by identifying stakeholders who need to be involved in debates and decisions. A question posed by Mr. Ren was who determines who should be involved? Decisions about the level of environmental protection versus economic development are important: downstream countries make use of natural and water resources to meet development objectives, typically with biodiversity losses and natural resource deterioration. Climate change and hydropower development, including accounting for El Nio and La Nia cycles, are important. "," Mr Ren noted an increase in regionalism and the need for muliti-lateral cooperation, especially concerning cross-border matters. External (non-state) stakeholders and local communities need to be involved and introduce a local voice. These need to be heard, and are currently the weakest link in promoting cooperation and opposing geo-political attitudes. In April, the MRC entered discussions in China and Mr Ren noted a change in Chinese attitude where the MRC voice was listened to. The data-sharing of water flows by the LMCM is an important opportunity to be built upon. "," Mr Ren was not able to identify Lancang-Mekong examples but was familiar with transboundary examples from Canada and the USA. Critical point was cross country (upstream-downstream) agreement about water allocations. These agreements were reached very early in negotiations, including agreed compensation for agreement breaches and country obligations. Compensation may be in monetary or non-monetary. "," Mr Ren was familiar with LMCM and the MRC, but not other platforms. Examples provided were the GMS, ASEAN and ACMECS. Mr Ren noted the lack of information-sharing as a key impediment; and is necessary as a starting point for cooperation. Water flows represent technical information only and social exchange (we assume data and analysis) is limited. The lack of social and economic data does not foster mutual understanding and trust. "," The LMC and MRC agreements are not legally binding nor describe enforceable country obligations. Mr Ren noted the differences (that is legally binding) example of the Canada-USA transboundary agreements. International investors need to observe and adhere to national investment regulations. The same principle applies to water resource management. The second level are international laws and treaties as a guide to river governance, possibly deferring to international arbitration for enforcement and dispute resolution. Mr Ren noted the main problem with international treaties is the lack of an implementation mechanism. ", IWRM: the World Bank has substantial convening power and leadership to promote transboundary country discussions. This represents an opportunity to design and coordinate an agreed integrated basin plan. ," Mr Ren noted environmental social governance. The environment can be quantified; social effects are more difficult to evaluate. Mutual trust is needed by riparian countries to address common social outcomes and impacts. Mr Ren noted a DFAT evaluation that most stakeholders do not have sufficient field experience to assess social conditions: most rely on desktop analysis which is not sufficient. Field research is critical for robust social assessments, especially at the household level. Technical analysis can be leveraged, but since April, Mr Ren has noticed a reduction in mutual trust concerning social data sharing. Most social discussions are political and superficial. "," Upstream countries are more influential than downstream: Vietnam is the most downstream and China the most upstream. Media coverage has focussed on Chinese dams, but Laos also has numerous dams, which have received less attention, and affect Vietnam. "," Local government needs to assume a main role. China has important insights and lessons to share with LMB countries regarding the trade-offs of developments. Mr Ren mentioned water and air pollution as a result of development. Environment protection (and utilisation) are sovereign rights, whereby exploitation of natural resources are a means to reduce poverty. Local people need to be involved with and actually making these NR choices, which are an important opportunity for support by the World Bank and international organisations. In response to question about ownership of the process, Mr Ren noted excellent energy plans prepared by the ADB and AIIB for Myanmar. The reports remain on the shelf, had no effect on policy and energy decisions and have not been converted into actions. Mr Ren highlighted co-design as a critical step in ownership and decision-maker buy-in. If policy and decision-makers are not involved in the program design, there is a very low likelihood of program influence on actions taken","Ren Peng,"," Program Manager (Overseas Investment,"," Trade and the Environment Program),"
Interview 25 - Yan Feng -kc.docx," Climate change is now challenging the water resources of the Mekong. Population density is generally high. Urbanisation is also a challenge, particularly in the upper basin. Amongst the six countries are those whose infrastructure is lagging behind. We know that there is severe pollution. She references saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta and ecosystem deterioration in Cambodia. So too, the distribution of water over time and space varies from upstream and downstream. In the upper basin, there is lots of rainfall during the summer, but less downstream. Drought will be more severe in the future. So, these are some of the distinct challenges, which are getting more acute. "," What does sustainable development mean? Each riparian has a different understanding and challenges depending on population, water security. Water cooperation can be leveraged to support cooperation in other SDG. There are some institutions with a good foundation, such as the MRC. An example of good cooperation here is their navigation programme she discussed shipping for a moment. But we need to ask if it is actually transboundary cooperation. In some local areas, there are positive outcomes, but at basin scale, not really. Many people think that we do not have science-based decision-making. But China has now committed to data-sharing with the downstream countries. There is progress in cooperation, but we have to see if a joint basin development plan emerges. "," There are dozens of frameworks to promote each of the Mekong countries. But most of these are focussed on economic development and trade. Very few are focussed on water or the basin such as the MRC and the LMC. The GMS focusses on the environment, but how much does it focus on water? "," The primary mechanism is the LMC because it includes water in its core business. For the other frameworks, water is not their core business. The GMS framework focuses on environmental protection including water. They only become aware of water if it is affected by their activities. Water is also central to the MRC. China has also supported transboundary cooperation focussed on capacity building, but this is not enough. The trade-based frameworks do not focus enough on water, fisheries, or water pollution. The latter has only gained attention in the past two years, via an inter-governmental platform for monitoring established by the MRC. "," A balanced ecosystem with integrity. There are those who argue that there are ulterior motives behind these various cooperation initiatives; there are also those who create barriers to cooperation. These little disputes and arguments are not conducive to river basin cooperation or achieving the SDGs. All problems floods, droughts etc. can be addressed and solved through cooperation. Typically, only one voice Is heard. "," There is a lot of interest in economic growth and trade. But there is not enough attention to water. We see progress in transportation and connectivity cooperation. But water, and upstream-downstream coordination is difficult. Each country has its own development targets, so regional priorities are not consistent across the basin. Is there enough water for downstream irrigation to meet increasing population due to hydropower development? We can start simply focussing, for example, on drought or floods. The MRC has been looking at this, but without good results. In April and May, there were media reports saying that there was not good cooperation between upstream and downstream countries, but it should be remembered that the LMC has only just started. It is possible for the countries to agree on a common goals and interests around complex problems. For example, fish biodiversity We need coordination around water-sharing there is enough water; it is more a space and timing thing. There are a dozen transboundary rivers and 100 tributaries that cross borders where China is upstream and downstream countries are often under developed. The Canada -US water agreements are an example that China is learning from. Joint planning and water quality monitoring is progressing with Russia. Indian cooperation is moving slowly. Matching the river development goals of China with downstream countries is a challenge. "," Cooperation is a general trend, but there are factors that influence its rate. Every country has different economic growth needs. When they implement their plans, this hinders cooperation but every country has a right to development. National economic interests dictate decisions. Another challenge is knowing the water account. People have different understanding of drought. There has been a huge reduction in precipitation. We all face climate change. But we do not have a real scientific basis for explaining drought. This results, Prof. Feng argues, in different perceptions of the drought and what/who are responsible. She mentions the WLE Dams Database which, she says, shows that total reservoir storage on the upstream is similar to that of the downstream so this cannot be seen as the cause of drought. It is possible for us to establish the scientific basis for why drought has arisen. Once this has been established, then we can talk about water-sharing. There is, Prof. Feng says, an overlap in the MRC and LMC mandates. How, she wonders, can we coordinate between the two? Can we strengthen some of the areas that the MRC is good at. The LMC has the benefit that it includes all six countries. But there are those who say that the LMC may weaken the MRC. The MRC has a long history. By creating it, the four countries showed their intention to collaborate around water resources. Kim Geheb (Mekong Futures) asks why China has not joined the MRC? Dr. Feng replies that, back then, when the MRC was created, there were those who felt that the China should not be a partner. Without the involvement of China there is large technology gap. But it is a dialogue partner of the MRC. Back then China has its reservations about the MRC and wanted to hold back to see how this multilateralist approach would work. But she is concerned that the outlook for water governance in the Mekong is confusing because of the LMC/MRC overlapping mandate. "," The general public who are affected the most. The countries that share the basin should be the most influential actors. China and Vietnam are possibly the most influential countries in the basin. Vietnam is the most downstream country, so perhaps it should be the most influential. When it comes to Mekong Vision 3.0, we need to prioritise research institutions. And then the financial institutions, followed by independent third parties. Sustainable development, Prof. Feng points out, is still development, and we need money for it. Hence, the importance of financial institutions. We need to have a scientific basis so that we can know where we should start to know what it is that we want to achieve. Maybe the EU, South Korea and the US would be willing to contribute towards Mekong Vision 3.0. Prof. Feng says that it would be her preference to work with independent, neutral, third parties. "," We need short-, mid- and long-term coordination and integrated plan that is practical and implementable. Such an approach should consider economic growth taking into account the environment","Prof. FENG Yan,"," Master Supervisor and Director of Transboundary Water Resources Laboratory at the Asia International Rivers Center,"," Yunnan University,"
Interview 26 - Zhong Yong - kc.docx," There are many challenges. The uneven distribution of rainfall in time and space, and more. This has been intensified by climate change. Drought has caused significant economic losses to the Mekong people. Water has become one of the key issues in the sustainable development of the Lancang-Mekong (LM). How, Dr Zhong wondered, can we create a shared dialogue on how to do this? All the LM countries have a right to economic development. Rapid economic development has led to natural resource declines. Sustainable growth needs to be shared by all Lancang-Mekong countries. It is the responsibility of the LMC to promote the development of the individual countries people and narrow the development gap. Countries have a right to develop their economies. "," Shared benefits and responsibility for shared prosperity. Reciprocity and trust are necessary. We are required to adopt more scientific management. Regional cooperation mechanisms play an important role in this, such as the MRC and the GMS. With increased socio-economic improvements, there is also increased willingness to cooperate. Dr. Zhong has 20 years of involvement in transboundary cooperation. He senses, he says, a strong willingness amongst the six countries to cooperate. He really thinks that all governments and even NGOs are willing to sit together in discussions to find good ideas to promote cooperation. The countries are facing are facing similar challenges when it comes to water resources, for example, floods and droughts. Underdeveloped water infrastructure leads to lower productivity. Many local people do not have access to clean water; food production is not stable, and farmers could earn more with irrigation and other facilities. The LM collects the countries very closely. It is a large, complex river, and therefore more cooperation is needed. The six leaders have committed to sustainable development in a joint 2019 statement. Within sustainable development, it is necessary to strengthen water governance with a comprehensive approach that includes the environment, and social and economic outcomes. Reciprocity is important for any cooperation if it is to last in the long run it must be based on mutual trust, respect and benefit-sharing in which everyone benefits. Dr Zhong pointed out his expertise in the field of reciprocity, and draws our attention to the 2016 paper he published on the subject. "," There are many examples since the start of the LMC. They now have a five-year action plan, a programme document that guides cooperation, principles, priorities, financial and intellectual support, and institutional arrangement. This means sharing benefits and expertise, and to help each other to face these challenges. The latter is the most fundamental support for the quality of river basin management. To strengthen water cooperation. The First Ministerial Meeting (of the LMC) was held in December 2019, in which the ministers agreed to respect each others rights to economic development, and the right to decide on how to utilise their own water resources. Joint studies have occurred, as has data and information-sharing. The LMC holds regular ministerial meetings. The next one will be in Vietnam early next year (notwithstanding the pandemic). This would be the second one. Concrete implementation occurs via the Joint Working Group. All decisions of the ministerial meetings will be supported by the Water Cooperation Center. We have an LMC Water Cooperation Forum. The first was held in Kunming in 2018. The second is delayed due to the pandemic, and is now planned for the second half of 2021. More than one thousand colleagues from the Mekong countries were invited to China by the Water Center for capacity building or for the Forum. They have also sponsored five batches some 140 young professionals for masters degrees in China. Many Chinese experts have visited the Mekong countries to gain counsel. There is very good mutual trust for future cooperation. China has been sharing hydrological data in the wet seasons. Recently, they have agreed to share data year-round. This emerged from a request from the lower Mekong countries. Population growth has resulted in greater water demands, and so more information is needed to plan for this. Information-sharing plays an important role in mitigating flood and drought. There should be transparent and comprehensive information-sharing because now, big challenges like drought and flooding do not just affect one country. How can we manage these disasters, and benefit more? Information-sharing is not easy amongst the six countries, but there is strong will. In September (2020) there was a special meeting of the Joint Working Group to establish the basis for information-sharing. It sought more concrete actions to achieve this. "," Why are there so many frameworks? Water is very important, but most of them are rooted in other issues. The different mechanisms have made good contributions to the Mekong countries. Dr Zhong has visited the other Mekong countries more than 50 times. Two experiences stand out, of which the first was when he was invited to Thailand as an expert, to advise on the Chao Phraya floods 2011; and then in a similar capacity to Myanmar for the 2015 Irrawaddy floods. People lost lives in these floods, and their homes. Factories and industries were affected. Dr Zhong was most impressed by the poor families, living in 10 square metres, their houses leak these are people who could benefit so much from this water, so why are they living like this? But they have no budget, and no effective institutions to manage these waters. The local people have a right to food security and to access clean water to prevent COVID-19. So, I think that whatever mechanism that wants to improve local peoples living standards is welcome. The LMC was set up by the six countries with strong will, and will bring strong support to local communities. There are still big challenges we are open; we will work with any of the mechanisms that would like to improve the local living standards. But why do local people know so little about the LMC? The LMC has focussed more on action and less on communications. We want to improve on this by working with the World Bank. Dr Zhong was at a workshop where there was a person for whom everything about dams was wrong. If the public has no understanding of the benefits of dams, then they will get a very wrong message. Hydropower provides energy and flood control; they can save lives, improve navigation conditions and food supply. They can also improve ecologies during the dry season. In Thailand, the local people are taught that dams are bad. Local people need to have clear, balanced information but they are misled. Dr Zhong wants the LMC Water Cooperation Centre to play a role in providing this balanced perspective. ", The LMC is a cohesive and centrifugal force for co-operation. We have recognised difficulties and challenges. Efforts should be made to improve water security. The sign of our success is the livelihoods of regional people. We are doing water safety projects. It is not the business or privilege of other (outside) countries to improve living standards this is the responsibility of their governments. ," Water challenges have become a global challenge. Climate change is especially serious in this respect, introducing uncertainty and complexity, and is a major problem in this region. In Laos, we have drought in the north, and floods in the south at the same time. In one country! This complicates things. How can we face this kind of challenge? Two months ago, there was an MRC report that came out that water infrastructure as a key challenge. We need more capacity building, more transparent information-sharing, and more coordinated management. We need evaluation and forecasting for better benefits with limited skills. Both I and Dr Hatda (CEO of the MRC) think that more cooperation is needed. The LMC is six countries while the MRC is four. Naturally, there is overlap. But we can support and learn from each other. Overlap is not a disadvantage. Dr Zhong references the MOU between the LMC and the MRC. Sustainable development is a common goal. "," The technology deficit prevents cooperation. Data and information are not transparent enough, and there is limited infrastructure to build coordinated action for floods and droughts. But the six countries pay close attention to water cooperation. I am confident that we can face these challenges. The political will is there to improve living standards. Our cooperation is supported at government and grassroots levels. The six countries have clear cooperation. We know each other and respect each other. ", Governments like the left-hand and the right-hand; all the Mekong countries are equal. ," At the first ministerial meeting, all the governments paid close attention to water infrastructure to meet the needs of the people for sustainable development. There are differences between the countries in terms of culture, their different development stages. Any responsible government has an obligation to improve livelihoods and to protect them from flood and drought. We need water for everything this means that there are some contradictions. This is normal. Responsible government must be truthful and transparent to their people. Water infrastructure might affect some of us, or some ecologies but this is our only choice for food security. There is no absolute democracy. Any action we take will affect somebody. Sustainable development does not mean no change. In our society, we have to evolve with ecologies. We need more scientific understanding; and we need to take into account future generations","Dr Zhong Yong,"," Chief Executive Officer,"," Water Cooperation Center,"
Interview 27 - Tek Vannara -kc.docx," The main challenge is the imbalance between economic and environmental development. There are six countries and so there are six perspectives, each with their own economic priorities and the economy is always prioritised. They never use environmental indicators or assessments in their planning. There are no environmental values indicated in EIAs. The economic losses of natural resource utilization are not included. If these are included, then it favours the policy-maker. There are no limits to development for example, to set aside certain amounts of land, or forest, to conserve the Mekong. There are many actors involved and Mr Tek lists multiple frameworks of which he is aware. They need to agree together what the limits to development should be, in full consultation with the people, to develop a master plan for the Mekong. This plan should make clear that the tributaries, and connectivity between the river and the rest of the basin. We would like to see rules for the international banks. The World Bank has recourse mechanisms, but many others do not have this. With many developers and money owners, if people have concerns there is no way for them to express them. Enabling this should be prioritised. "," As it stands now, it is government-to-government, and government-to-private sector. This cooperation is good. But cooperation with the people is not good. Some of the things discussed at the MRC are good. Here, at both the regional and international agendas, we can see where the people are. This is not the case with the LMC. The people should be prioritised for discussions on the mainstream dam projects. Many people do not understand the reports from the PNPCA process, because they come in English. And the reports can be very long. Some people do not even know what EIA is. And the time for consultations are very short. We want more engaged regional cooperation so that people can react. Some people have resources, so they can react. The countries should align transparently, accountability and with consultation to address all actors equally. We want all actors to have a common mechanism and basin that includes all developer plans, dams and operations. Mr Tek references the MRCs Mekong Development Strategy (BDS), which he approves of. There are many types of consultation, he says. But they differ in terms of quality. With the PNPCA there are many consultations, but then you have all of these problems with the language the reports come in. Also, the perspectives of the people are not reflected in the PNPCA report recommendations. Mr Tek references what he says are the ignored community recommendations around the Don Sahong hydropower plant (on the mainstream in Laos). Knowledge management is biased against local communities. There is generally no response or action by developers to the PNPCA. "," Mr Tek thinks that the MRC is a good mechanism. The LMC should, he says, be integrated into the BDS. The MRC has produced a lot of information which is useful for planning. Even though all the countries prioritise economic development, the MRC addresses the environment. Each country has their own development plans The World Bank, Mr Tek says, has a focus on river basin organisations. But we want to see that they are workable, that they have the capacity to respond to basin challenges e.g. forested watersheds, river flows to support fish populations and community ecotourism. Also, the World Bank wants sustainability, and we also want to see community environmental management systems kept in place. "," We appreciate the various mechanisms, but their treaties do not address conflict, dispute resolution or transparency or accountability. They just talk about cooperation and information-sharing. Also, there are no recourse mechanisms for the people. "," The governments and the people know the master plans within which they can all participate. All parties have to understand the big picture, and to know and respect the rules and regulations and that all actors are recognised. Cooperation would also be successful if benefit-cost sharing emerges. There needs to be sufficient resources for all to enable collaboration. All actors must have mutual respect and trust. "," Cooperation is prevented when people do not agree with development. If problems are identified (by anyone), JICA will stop their project, and resolve the matter before continuing. But with some projects, the information is secret and there are many unknowns. So, Mr Tek thinks there should be regulations to ensure project plans are disclosed. These will reduce problem complexity. He speaks favourably about the recommendations of the World Commission on Dams, and feels that these should be applied. Large-scale projects should have an environmental focus and not just on the economic perspective. Common property needs to be guaranteed. An example of common property is water of sufficient quality if people are poor, they should not be made to buy water that they cannot afford. "," The MRCs 1995 Agreement contains articles on consultation but then the results are not implemented. They should use mediation to move forwards. Without treaties, then theres no progress. Benefit-sharing enables cooperation. We need information disclosure, inclusive decision-making, transparency, and indicators that we can use to evaluate if developers are addressing their action plans. We need regulations to ensure that they deliver on their action plans. The Cambodia National Mekong Committee and the government could enforce these, with the MRC addressing this at the regional level. The important thing about treaties is that they introduce third parties into the process, which is helpful if there are any disputes. "," This is linked to the resource flow whoever has the best access to it is the most influential. The Mekong belongs to its countries. We have different cultures, economies and environments. And different capacities. But the people also have influence. He mentions a Mekong Peoples Council that could engage with the MRC. If people only engage for, say, a day, then it is not really consultation. But with a council such as this, then the people could engage over the long-term, and understand the issues better, and be empowered. He seems to suggest that the people would only be influential if they are organised around such a Council, for example, to have an equal voice in negotiations. Access to information is also critical. Mr Tek calls for bottom-up consultation. With top-down consultation, decision-makers do not have the full picture like how the people are connected with the environment. The people also need to be aware so that they have the big picture, and they can understand it and then talk freely. "," We need limits. For example, a limit on how many dams there should be. And to give space for Mekong environmental sustainability. In addition, we need benefit-sharing. With the existing dams, how can we share the benefits into, for example, fisheries, or sharing the money that they get from this infrastructure. There needs to be an openness to balancing economic development with sustainable development. We need to ensure that a basin master plan addresses connectivity (of the people with nature?) and equitable benefit-sharing. It is difficult, Mr Tek concludes, to obtain sustainability when you only go country by country","Mr TEK Vannara,"," Director,"," NGO Forum for Cambodia (Phnom Penh),"
Interview 28 - MRC -kc.docx," Dr Hatda: these are all identified in the Council Study and the MRCs State of the Basin Report (SOBR). Amongst the significant ones: the permanent change to the Mekongs flow regime. This has led to reductions to sediments, fisheries, riparian environment, wetlands, and caused significant local flooding. To manage the mainstream, we need to understand what is happening on the tributaries. Dr Hatda hopes that the MRCs next Strategic Plan (SP) will address this, especially in terms of data-sharing. From January to July 2020, there was lowflow and drought in the region. This will get more frequent, and the countries will need to work together in order to address this. "," Dr Hatda: cooperation is very important for the MRC. They believe that there are 12 regional cooperation frameworks. They see the LMC and the Mekong-US partnership as being the most important. The MRC is the only treaty-based orgainisation in the region. We must continue to build on our strengths, which they say other frameworks do not have. The MRC has a clear mandate to promote cooperation, and a focus on water. Other frameworks have a broader scope. In the next Strategic Plan, we plan to work with the LMC. Only the six countries (that share the Mekong) can work on their own (domestic) problems. Our task is to invite them together to address regional challenges. Dr Hatda references the MOU that the MRC has with the Water Cooperation Centre of the LMC, but says that cooperation needs to be further enhanced to, in particular, address drought and low flows. The MRC is an observer on the LMCs Joint Working Group (JWG) on Water, where he suggests that perhaps an expert working group could be established to address these issues. He also hopes that China will write the Chinese parts of the next State of the Basin Report. While China is now sharing hydrological data with the MRC, this is only from two hydromet stations. The MRC needs more data on this including on water storage in the upper basin. Dr Kittikhoun: regional cooperation needs to promote the only agreement in town (i.e. the 1995 Agreement). Dr Kittikhoun states the principles of cooperation, and what these mean. We often hear about the problems that development brings; but there are still great development needs in the basin. It is these needs that we must address. Dr Kittikhoun claims that infrastructure regulates only 15% of the Mekong flows. The MRC has had a long-standing dialogue with China, and also the with LMC but the latter has limitation in terms of who drives the agenda. The MRC is lucky to have representation on the JWG, so that it can avoid duplication with the LMC. There are, he says, increasing transaction costs because the countries have to engage with both the MRC and the LMC. There is also a role for development partners, from whom there has always been great support and interest. We should, through the MRC, to encourage them (the DPs) to cooperate with each other, and to avoid competition between super-powers. Dr Hatda: we cannot always get what we want right away (from China). We cannot rush. The public, he says, trusts the MRC. The MRC, he points out, made comments on the Eyes on Earth Report. We have the capacity to do these kinds of things. The MRC is well established and mature. The LMC has its Joint Working Group and is still a dream (because it is so young). While he doesnt know what the LMCs long-term plans are, he thinks that they are trying to learn from the MRC. Dr Kittikhoun: One clear difference between the MRC and the LMC is that China co-leads the LMC; it drives the LMCs agenda. China probably thinks that because it is a regional leader it should be driving the agenda. This is not how things work in the MRC, which, Dr Kittikhoun argues, is part of its comparative advantage. Dr Hatda: increased (transaction) costs mean that we have to ensure that the MRC and the LMC complement each other. The MRC needs to be ahead of the game; we need to strengthen our capacity in knowledge production and management. We were created long ago, we have our procedures, guidelines etc. The LMC is project-based and still in its infancy. The LMC is only a cooperative mechanism, while the MRC is a River Basin Organisation (RBO). The Mekong countries can be proud of the MRC, where they can and do still come to discuss solutions. Dr Winai: it is very easy to establish data-sharing platforms (which the LMC and MRC have done), but it is more difficult to ensure that it is sustainable. In the MRC, the member countries share data, and the MRC processes it. This makes the data legitimate to the member countries because they provide it. Dr Hatda: at the moment, our decision-support framework is used for planning purposes. But now we need to deal with operations (of hydropower?). This would put the MRC in a better position to address regulated flows. This could be an opportunity for the World Bank. It is up to the member countries (of the LMC) to define how cooperation will occur between them. Dr Kittikhoun: for the four MRC member countries, cooperation is clear. But this is not the case for the LMC, because it is not an RBO. Their framework addresses the projects that are needed for development. Its starting point is not the river basin. It is probably good for the time being that the LMC does not work on this (on a basin perspective). The LMC has a very particular role in the basin, while the MRCs is broader. Dr Hatda: the door is open for the MRC to welcome China (into its membership), but this is Chinas decision; as it is to establish a different kind of framework. Dr Hatda wonders how the MRC will harness the various regional frameworks? We have moved the MRC closer to other initiatives like the GMS, the ASEAN Secretariat and the LMC. As an observer to the LMC, we know what is going on in there, and we advise out member countries before their LMC meetings so that they can synergise the countries, and to harness other initiatives. I have a strong belief in the member countries to continue using the MRC as a cooperative framework. Dr Kittikhoun: China has a very bilateral approach to river basin management. The LMC is not a river basin framework. Its members exchange ideas for river projects. The MRC is multilateral which is a different approach, and this is why China has not joined the MRC. For Myanmar, they have a very small interest in the Mekong. At the last MRC Summit, the Myanmar minister said that they were happy to remain an observer. The LMC can include the whole region to include the Irrawaddy and the Salween, so that is why Myanmar joined it. "," Dr Hatda: it is too early for the LMC to have results, and premature to understand its impacts. When China agreed to share data (with the MRC) it was a good start. The first data arrived on November 1, 2020. But they (the MRC) continue to need more. "," Dr Hatda: we can share with you our analysis on this. Of course, we need to synergise and avoid duplication. The frameworks have a broad cooperation area. For the MRC, it is water. This is very clear and specific. "," Dr Kittikhoun: In M&E, there are many indicators of success. If cooperation is judged successful, it is because it had met the cooperation goal. One key indicator is adequate data-shring. Another is whether or not differences and tensions have been managed. He sees evidence in the MRC of this, because the member countries still use it has a platform for discussion. This is not what happens with other frameworks, where the countries sometimes turn to the media, or to external actors to try and push for their perspectives. Dr Hatda: He wants to stress that the SOBR and the SP can assess the success of cooperation. For Dr Hatda, vision is a long-term thing. This is why the MRCs vision does not change, although in the new SP, they have added climate resilience. Sustainable development is very complex and difficult. The MRC has worked with its member countries to help them understand the 1995 Agreement (where sustainable development is writ large). Their development trajectories are very much defined by their needs, and national interest is very important for them all. It is challenging to convince the member countries to create the balance (between economic and sustainable development) but the 1995 Agreement and the MRCs procedures remain valid. In the next SP, there is a need to revisit the procedures. We also stress the importance of uptaking previous SPs have stressed knowledge, but it is important that the member countries actually use this. It is also important to be able to show each countrys success related to the other (member) countries. Dr Kittikhoun: in principle, sustainable development is understood by the member countries. The differences emerge when they practice it. If you look at the SDGs, Laos and Cambodia stress those parts of it that address economic growth. For the other SDGs, they try to mitigate the impacts of development. At the MRC, we look at trends from the avoidance, mitigation and compensation perspective. Maybe we need to use a limits to growth approach like Japan that compensates by setting aside natural resources that will not be developed. "," Dr Hatda: the issue is the shortage of data. Cooperation in the future will be driven by data and information. This is why China has sought a data-sharing platform. We need to understand the operating rules and storage capacity of the Chinese dams. The core issue is that the river is no longer natural, and there are many impacts because of this. Now, you have to manage the flows in order to mitigate the impacts of regulation. Sharing water then becomes another issue. This is why we want to revisit the Procedures for Maintenance of Flow on the Mainstream. Dr Kittikhoun: in response to a question from John Ward (Mekong Futures) on social and economic data, Dr Kittikhoun responds that this has to do with the way in which the data will be used. Some member countries feel that, in the absence of a model to assess socio-economic impacts, that the data will be misused. Nevertheless, many of these data are in any case publicly available. At national levels, it is very clear that impacted people need to be compensated; but this is not clear in the transboundary context which projects causing what impacts downstream. It is very complex to determine this. This is why the member countries resist this. He suggests that a fund could be established to support adaptation without attribution. Dr Hatda: after every PNPCA, the MRC has never issued a reasonable and equitable statement (another key tenet in the 1995 Agreement) because this is not well defined. We need this fund (that suggested by Dr Kittikhoun) to address this. Thailand also stressed it, and they call it an endowment fund. "," Dr Hatda: for an RBO like the MRC, hope and trust is needed amongst the countries. The members have to see the value of the MRC. The countries are now engaged with other frameworks, the MRC now has to focus on strengthening its core functions monitoring, assessment capacity, planning, pro-active planning so that the member countries can see the benefits of cooperation with each other. The countries need to align their development needs with other countries needs. This is very challenging and very delicate. Dr Kittikhoun: trust is required to enable and sustain cooperation. Without it, the countries would be suspicious of each other. In addition, there need to be clear agreements that they all subscribe to. Cooperation requires procedures. Standards and guidelines are also required, and for these, an institution for discussion is needed, so that it does not all turn to nonsense. In addition, we need (international) partners the countries at the right time. And finally, there is a role of public or NGOs. There are those (NGOs) who have a very skewed perception, which can create distrust and disengagement, and this can ruin cooperation. "," Dr Hatda: cooperation is not a zero-sum game. You cannot ask for equal cooperation, or equal benefits, or equal access. China co-chairs every LMC meeting. In the MRC, every country has equal footing and the same opportunity to cooperate. Nevertheless, in the LMC every country has an opportunity to express its views. Dr Kittikhoun: In the LMC, China proposes and drives the agenda. The countries can chip in. In the MRC, no country sets the agenda. Some observers might think that Thailand or Vietnam does this, but this is not the case. China, to be fair, is also a good listener. "," Dr Kittikhoun: When projects have already been decided upon, all you can do is share data on possible impacts. If you dont do this, you reduce the opportunities for engagement or to monitor impacts. Projects proposed over the long-term, there may be opportunities to influence, and for new joint project put in place. When projects have been approved and decision already made, opportunities for revision are very limited. In the longer term, there is some opportunity for revision or investigating alternatives. The MRC looks at maximising system benefits, and minimising transboundary impacts. We have uptake guidelines. If it meets their needs, the countries will use it. We need to do a better job at assessing these needs. In closing the meeting, Dr Hatda wanted to stress that the next SP will be a game changer for the MRC. It will equip the commission to deliver services based on its core functions","Dr An Pich Hatda (CEO),"," Dr Anoulak Kittikhoun (Chief Strategy and Partnership Officer) Dr Winai Wangpimool (Director of Technical Support) and Dr Ly Sarann (Water and Climate Specialist),"," Mekong River Commission (Vientiane),"
Interview 29 - Fuqiang Tian -kc.docx," First, rapid socio-economic development and a very large population in the basin about 70 million; and second, climate change which increases the hydrological extremes in the basin. We have published several papers on this. The main risk is that the flood risk is increasing in the near term. And then, drought especially severe drought, is occurring more frequently. Prof Fuqiang argues that upstream dams can help to mitigate this, and the same is true of drought. Finally, there is also a capacity shortage. While we have established several cooperation frameworks, we still need additional capacity. "," Resources are unevenly distributed across the basin. Upstream, there are very large hydropower resources; lower down, there is agriculture and fisheries. Water connects all of these things. Prof. Fugiang had a PhD student who looked at the water-food-energy (WFE) nexus in the basin. There is, Prof. Fuqiang says, a synergistic opportunity for cooperation. Dams provide an opportunity to address all the WFE facets. But, upstream dams contrast with downstream agricultural demands a balance is needed between the WFE elements. Even fish can benefit from the re-operation of demands. If we use the infrastructure properly, we can even address ecosystem needs. If the rivers flood pulse is replicated (through dam operations), fish production from the Tonle Sap could increase 75%. The trade-offs between hydropower and fisheries is, however, significant. There are also trade-offs between hydropower and other water uses. We do not have a basin-level mechanism to address this. Perhaps this is something Mekong Vision 3.0 should address. "," Prof. Fuqiang references the 2016 supplementary releases from Chinese dams (to supply additional water to downstream, drought-affected countries. The 2015/16 and 2019/20 droughts in the basin were the most severe in 220 years. The supplement was not management, but an emergency response. But it was still a very good example of cooperation. If the upstream dams can collaborate through some mechanism to provide more regulatory supplements, this would be a good thing. If we had long-term forecasting, dams could then better plan for releases. We have no mechanism for this long-term forecasting. The LMC is a new initiative. The Ministry of Water Resources (China) is trying to work with the MRC to address this forecasting issue. "," To address the challenges (that he mentioned above) we need the 3 Is Information, Infrastructure and Institutions. Infrastructure is necessary to address flood, drought and fisheries production. The flood pulse also needs to be restored. We will need more storage to address this. I have already discussed Information this is needed to manage the infrastructure. As for Institutions, the LMC works beyond water. It addresses many things; there is also the GMS. These platforms all focus on different aspects of the cooperation spectrum. The basin is in good shape from a cooperation perspective, but we need more. More data sharing, more action on dam operation, and research. We still dont have common ground on some facts. We need collaboration on some of the critical things that he has already mentioned. There are many different opinions amongst international experts. Sharing knowledge is a first step and then we can move on to looking at the frameworks working together, for example, the LMC and the MRC. There can be a flood control effect if all dams in the basin are deployed, particularly in the mid-stream (but not downstream). But getting all of the dams in the basin to cooperate is very difficult. "," Benefit should be the key word. There are lots of benefits to be gained from transboundary water cooperation. Prof. Fuqiang references Claudia Sadoff and David Greys benefit-sharing paper, which he endorses. Achieving this the benefit-sharing as described by Sadoff and Grey would be a success. "," It is relatively easy to cooperate. This regularly happens around humanitarian issues, such as floods or drought. There is a clear causality here between cooperation and humanitarian problems. He refers to this as the hazard problem. "," Trust between the different countries. To promote this, communication is needed between countries, communities and different levels. There is a lot of academic cooperation in the Mekong Region. We work with actors in Thailand, Vietnam and Laos, and were trying to do more. On water, our group has done a lot in the broader field. It established the Asian Universities Alliance, with 15 universities in 14 Asian countries. "," Governments dominate. We are in good shape now between China and the downstream (Mekong) countries. There is a will to cooperate. This is a good signal. Under the LMC, students have been supported to come to China for masters degrees. I have PhD students from Thailand, and this capacity building can provide long-term influence. "," Any human action has an impact on natural resources. This should be evaluated in advance of the intervention. If we have this principle, maybe we can achieve the balance. But it is not easy. China has experienced rapid economic development over the past 40 years, and has derived lessons around the impact on resources, especially water. When we have enough resources, we can recover. But we can do better with the lessons we have derived from the development period. Balance is subjective, and different people will have different opinions on what it is, and we should allow them to have these. In China, we have a lot of experience with flood control. When we build levees to manage floods, then people move closer to the water, and this increases the risk. So, we have had to come up with different approaches for how we do things, rather than just building more levees","Professor TIAN Fuqiang,"," Associate Professor,"," Department of Hydraulic Engineering,"
Interview 30 - Diana Suhardiman -kc.docx," First, the current institutional arrangement is disconnected across scales, and between institutions. Things then run in parallel without connecting. Second, problem definition there are no agreements on problems. For some, hydropower is a problem, for others, it is a solution. Until this is addressed, everyone is talking at cross-purposes. Third, too many actors governments, NGOs, etc so there are so many overlaps and duplications between mandates, and their collective efforts are not integrated. This creates dispersion, and ensures that there is no common vision. Where there are visions, they do not represent local people: Representation becomes blurred. "," An equal partnership and a level playing field, with equal access to decision-making. Mechanisms are needed with checks and balances. The opportunities are there, and lie in the existing capacity, and interest. It is more about weaving this in a way that can heterogeneity. "," These exist. Dr Suhardiman references the PNPCA process, as is the Strategic Environmental Assessment of the Mekong Mainstream Dams. These cannot be regarded as management but they are a step in the right direction. As is the MRC, as a forum for discussion, to consider management options and how this should occur. The PNPCA process serves a s reference point, slows unchecked development and needs institutional support. When it comes to hydropower, there need to be links to the developers who are responsible for carrying out the EIAs, and SIAs. It is also important that these should be monitored and evaluated. But these are not linked to decision-making processes. The PNPCA process happening up at the MRC level is unrelated to the ESIAs. Right now, these are parallel processes. There is an assumption that the link is there. The MRC assumes that it will happen under the NMCs. But, in Laos, the LNMC is under MONRE, while hydropower is MEMs mandate, and MONRE will never win an argument with MEM. This is an important gap, which needs to be addressed if we want improvements. "," It is good that the frameworks are there. Compared to other basins, the Mekong is quite advanced. But in terms of improvements, the frameworks need to be more meaningful, which, for Dr Suhardiman, means that buy-in is possible for everyone, and that people can see how their perspectives are represented. With the LMC and MRC, there are geo-political issues to the degree that one has to wonder if their real goal is water management. But then we have to start looking at interests and politics. "," The first level is the inter-country level. Here, if the countries have a level playing field, and the platform will need to be able to absorb power asymmetries. When I talk about a level playing field, I am thinking about things like equal opportunities to gain access to and process information. It is very hard to get access to information on the Chinese dams. How, under such circumstances, can discussions and deliberation occur? The second level is local, and success here refers to the extent to which local communities and actors are represented, the capacity to process information and have opportunities to convey their perspectives. The production of knowledge is a political process. "," The collection of quantitative data and establishing data platforms for fisheries, hydrology, etc. From a cooperation perspective, this has been quite effective. But when it comes time to use data for decision-making purposes, then the data gets politicised. Science is often perceived as the solution to everything. But, in the decision-making space, this is not necessarily the case. Policy processes are regularly regarded as neutral, but they are never that. The politics in here can be more undermining than data. So too, knowledge collection and production is also political for example, in the choice of methodologies. "," Interests and factors can both enable and prevent cooperation. For example, politics can do both. "," What do you mean by influential actors? If it is about who can set up cooperative frameworks and mechanisms, it is the development partners. But if it is development and outcomes you are focussing on, then it is the governments. NGOs and CSOs are influential in open spaces international NGOs more than local ones. Researchers a very heterogeneous. Dr Suhardiman references debate around the establishing of a World Heritage Site for the Nu (Salween) River in Yunnan, where there were those academics who opposed it, and others who supported it. Academics are not a consistent actor group. When studies are released, we cannot automatically assume that it is an uncontested viewpoint. When we talk about the science-policy interface, it is an interface, with contrasting views and ways of doing things. Hence, it must be balanced (and not, say, resolved). In the Mekong, science has become highly politicised. "," It has to be linked with poverty reduction. For example, I cannot see how hydropower revenue is the same as poverty reduction how does this revenue link with, say, education, health care or other social provisioning? Economic growth is not a stand-alone indicator. The relationship between economic growth and poverty reduction needs to be unpacked. John Ward (Mekong Futures) asks why GDP is the primary metric of progress. Dr Suhardiman replies that people would rather not make things too transparent for many reasons corruption, or politics. Where does all the revenue go? Dr Suhardiman expressed the hope that Mekong Vision 3.0 will be much more representative of the people in the region","Dr Diana Suhardiman,"," Senior Researcher - Policy and Institutions; Governance and Inclusion Research Group Lead,"," International Water Management Institute,"
Interview 31 - Dr Poonpat Leesombatpiboon -kc.docx," The development issues are more complex now than before especially when dealing with multiple objectives. Water supply, hydropower etc. and all of the different stakeholder groups, who have different objectives. We cannot go in one direction to meet our goals; we need to take an holistic approach. The lack of understanding of stakeholders are particular areas of focus. If you ask environmentalists, they want the protection of the river, which may then lead to antagonism; policy makers want to bring the better life and they may not have many options available to them if they want to increase GDP. We need to balance between these for peace and development. Stakeholders may have access to different sets of information. The platforms that have been set up to bring them together often result in antagonism based on different information. We need to find a peaceful way, and which institution should be responsible for this. How can the people be educated? They have to know what alternatives there are if they are to be told that they have to sacrifice something. The government needs to be committed to the people if we are to have trust. If you promise jobs, and then you do not provide this, then they will not believe you next time. This is a serious problem. But the commitment is not just for the government to provide the people have to provide this as well. Dr Poonpat provides an example of affected people accepting a compensation package and then, later, demanding more. This too does not, he feels, result in trust. Trust is bi-directional "," The Mekong River is an international river. It is very important for all of the countries that share it. They must cooperate for peaceful life. But how can this be done. People might not have enough information for a long-term perspective. What will sustainable development provide the countries? And will ensure that options are realistic and do-able for the short- and long-term benefits. Most decision-makers are responsible for their peoples lives and how these can be improved. Agriculture for cooperation must be done in a sustainable manner. And then water for peoples lives, so that they have access to good quality, clean water. And, finally, hydropower for peoples lives, so that they may have electricity. "," Dr Poonpat thought that the MRCs procedures were an example of this. Each of the member countries has to follow these. He discusses the regional power trading initiative under the GMS, to support power trading across the region. This can create true development impact that can create more benefits. Thailand is connecting with Laos, China and Myanmar, he says. At the moment, Dr Poonpat says, Laos is seen as Thailands main export supply. Referencing Myanmar, he says that Thailand can help to bridge the gap between supply and demand with their grid. For example, enabling exports from Laos to Myanmar. "," There are, Dr Poonpat feels, too many frameworks, but there is a different rationale to each one of them. So, the relative advantages will differ. The MRC focusses more on the environment and livelihoods; ACMECS is more about economy, infrastructure and the social life; the LMC focusses on connectivity, infrastructure and capacity-building, providing training opportunities in its various focal areas; from time to time, the LMI also provides capacity building, but also gender, SMEs, and ensuring that hydropower works at maximum efficiency. "," Success in the context of the Mekong refers to the livelihoods of the people. Development should bring better life to the people. But Mekong benefits are not just for those who live in the immediate river area beyond the basin, power production serves to electrify countries and contributes to energy security, both of which Dr Poonpat considers important. How can we ensure that projects can bring the peaceful life of the people in those areas? Cooperation and collaboration are what are needed. Dr Poonpat says he does not want to see the Mekong becoming a source of conflict. It should be a source of cooperation. "," To be effective, we shouldnt jump to conclusions on the first day. Any large dam project will impact peoples lives. Information-sharing and the process of listening to people in these areas is necessary. Then compromise is possible. He suggests that, perhaps, public hearings are a way to do this but worries that this may not be efficient enough. Focus groups could be an alternative. At national levels, diplomatic channels are needed to create sufficient understanding you do not want a project to cause problems in the future. There have to be communications mechanisms between countries and with the people. If you are too silent, people will question you and it can turn into a serious problem. "," Trust. This can enable and its absence prevent. You need to do things in a transparent and accountable manner. Effective institutions are also necessary that can deliver development to the areas where projects will happen. And then political will from the governments is very important, that sends a clear signal to the stakeholders and the people. Dr Poonpat worries that there may be people in project areas who really understand the issues very well. But then the project takes too long, and they die or they move away, and the next generation do not understand the issues as well; and they are then in opposition, destroying the trust between the developer and the people. Also, financing if this is reduced for any reason, this can also destroy trust. "," Dr Poonpat cannot say. Each stakeholder can influence each other and play a role in bringing a project to success. Often, the people do not trust the government, so a third party is needed to confirm the message. International organisations can play this role such as the World Bank and the ADB. Academics can also play this role. "," This can be achieved through international commitments at least, those that have entered into Thai policy. For example, the UN defined carbon levels. The energy sector is moving towards lower carbon levels through renewable energy. The people need to use less in the right and wise way. In terms of economic development, we can lower the costs to the environment and improve development. So, for the government, it is about complying with these international commitments","Dr POONPAT Leesombatpiboon,"," Executive Director,"," International Affairs Division,"
Interview 32 - Niwat Roykaew -kc.docx," The biggest challenge is engagement. The people along the Mekong have no rights to, for example, manage the resources of the river. The second big challenge is leveraging the knowledge we have to develop the Mekong. Right now, the biggest motivation is economic development. But there has been so much research that shows that this does not work. Look at EIAs these are always conducted by just one party. The current structure of the Mekong Rivers development includes the MRC, the LMC and the LMI, and is only conducted by the state no one else. This is not very effective because it is focussed only on economic development. The PNPCA process is not working effectively because it seems like a public hearing. The MRC has no authority to intervene or to cancel a dam that is not good. The PNPCA is just a rubber-stamping exercise it cannot stop anything. The Thai government seems not to have an interest in the sustainable development of the Mekong even though it has eight provinces bordering the river. There is more interest in the Chao Phraya. Government agencies are not, Mr Niwat says, up to date on things. He wonders if they even know that there are 11 dams along the Mekong mainstream in China, and that there are two more on their way. They seem not to know. Mr Niwat speaks of the current drought, which he attributes to these latter dams but the Thai government says that it is waiting for a report from the Chinese government. This is not good enough. The Mekong is no longer a natural river, and this is not good at all. We need now to discuss water releases, so that these can support the rivers ecology. Also, the laws these are not issued fast enough to respond to the changing situation. He references the Xayaburi dam, which, he says, saw a lot of money moving from Thailand to Laos. Thai law does not address Thai investments in Laos, so developers and funders are not subject to the same standards as those operating inThailand. It is very important to list all of the challenges we are facing and to invite all the stakeholders to discuss them. He explains that his initiatives are looking to establish a council for the people living along the Mekong. It will meet on December 1-2, 2020 in Chiang Rai, and will include civil society, and academics. He thinks that the Chinese and Thai states will be there because they are very interested in these things. Representatives from all of the eight Mekong provinces will attend. This is an effort to promote and advocate for the participation of people in the development of the Mekong. And also so we can know where the people stand with respect to this development. The power now is in the hands of the state and the private sector. If the council is a success, it can be an example for other countries. Vietnam has expressed an interest. All of the MRC staff are from the state. Its policies are for the state. There is no public involvement. "," We have been hearing about cooperation for so long, but there is no clear definition of what it is. The opportunities for cooperation are only for the state and the private sector. There are no opportunities for the people to participate. Cooperation is between the government and the rich people with access to financing. "," In my experience, there has been no example of this yet. If there were, it would be an example of local people cooperating to conserve fisheries or something else. "," These mechanisms belong to the state and the investors, and focussed on economic development, when it should be on conservation and on restoration. ", The starting point is to open the space for candid dialogue and sharing. But the Mekong has now moved onto the political agenda. We have to accept that the importance of the Mekong is its environment and resources but people only look at it politically. It might even move onto the international security agenda. But we should be putting nature and development on the table. ," A successful model for solving the Mekongs problems is to use the knowledge base to come up with solutions. It should not be just Chinas perspective, or that of the US; but the bottom line is we have to ask what the Mekong people want or need not China or the US. It is the people who live with the Mekong who matter. "," The domestic political factors in each of the counties prevent cooperation. For example, the Thai (peoples) council can talk well with its Vietnamese counterparts; but not with their Lao counterparts. In Laos, they are reluctant to talk about politics and administration openly. It is big organisations who can promote local people and support them with knowledge and capacity building that can enable cooperation. Mr Niwat wonders if an AEAN Council for the People would not be a good idea in this respect. "," There is no single one. If you want effective sustainable development cooperation, there must be collaboration between governments, academia and the people. There cannot be a most influential actor in this arrangement. "," If the government achieves all of the SDGs, then the Mekong will be sustainable. In the past, we talked about mega-projects to development. But this kind of talking is now obsolete. Building the dams is just about money. Dam is money, not power (electricity). Developing the Mekong by focussing only on money will get us nowhere","Mr Niwat Roykaew,"," Founder and Chair,"," Chiang Khong Conservation Group and Mekong School on Local Knowledge (Chiang Rai),"
Interview 8 - Robert Allen -kc.docx," Mr Allen felt that there were three key issues: first, that development has been progressing very rapidly that has led to both positive and negative impacts on the river. Industrial development has led to pollution, agricultural development has led to large amounts of water being syphoned off and agricultural runoff increased, housing development has led to increased demand for sand, etc. There hasnt been a systematic look at the potential impacts of development and where these will occur and no one talks about this. Other countries that have experienced rapid growth provide valuable lessons. Second, demand for electricity is growing regionally. It will be a big challenge to get the countries to talk with each other about power generation and supply, and for power systems to work together. Most decision-makers dont know anything about power production. By way of example, he pointed out that there is almost no storage hydropower in Laos (mostly one year) most of it is run-of-river. This casts up questions of coordination and planning between countries. Third, the issues of national sovereignty, and planning for individual countries rather than the region as a whole. He referenced what he saw as the US problems around water supply, expensive litigation and conflict, and his concerns around water wars implying that something similar could happen in the Mekong. "," Mr Allen felt that technical cooperation was something that was really missing from between the countries. The technical side of things gets too politicised. Political and technical cooperation gets mixed up, which, he felt, should not happen. The bigger problem is that the countries should be looking for ways to cooperate on, for example generation demand planning, so that there is a net benefit for the region as a whole, rather than privileging individual nations. Forecasting (power) demand is very difficult. I dont know of a single utility in the world thats got it right. The Chinese have multi-year storage behind their dams; in Thailand, the dams have perhaps a years storage. This needs to be taken into account when it comes to planning discussions. Forecasting is nearly always national, and not regional. He pointed out that demand growth in NE Thailand is nearly always twice national demand and this rarely appears in the data. Laos doesnt have the technical capacity or an effective national grid to move electricity around. He also complained that weather forecasting is very poor in Laos. How El Nio or El Nia will affect Laos is something he can never find out, and this is data he needs to run his plant. Laos does have a national coordination group that meets to discuss export needs and likely dam water discharges "," Maybe the Xayaburi and its redesign to manage sediment flushing: not sure if those releases mimic natural sediment flux as no information has been forthcoming. But no, he cant really think of an example. "," There is a huge opportunity for technical data cooperation. Technical cooperation is not contentious. If you blend in the political it all becomes challenging. The LMC, he felt, could foster technical discussions in the Mekong. It is very hard to get treaties between more than two countries the political side of such conversations will be long and difficult. So, it is best to separate out technical cooperation from political this way, the technical cooperation can advance, while the political cooperation happens more slowly. Kim Geheb [Mekong Futures] asks if some data does show to governments things that they do not want to here. Mr Allen replies that such data does not have to be made public; but it does have to be discussed. When cooperation does not occur, then decisions are made in isolation. That is a very bad outcome. Engineers gossip with engineers. Engineers do not gossip to scientists. In Laos, the peak (hydropower production) months are April and May; while in China they are in July. This provides opportunities for cooperation around power supply and sharing. The data from this can be discussed confidentially, although I have my reservations about this and then recommendations fed upwards to decision makers. A regional technical forum would be useful. The private sector is often consulted by the Lao authorities for national-level issues but not so for regional discussions. HP dam safety is current theme. For us, the basin committees (in Laos) are ok for agriculture but useless for hydropower. Again, no one understands hydropower or how it works. "," Other than their press releases? (Joke). I think changes in policies or procedures agreed upon between the countries. For example, we have for some years been asked (by the government) to indicate how much of the water we release will reach the Mekong. I believe that this is because of agreements between the countries off the back of LMC discussions, prompted by political and media pressure. "," The Xayaburi (hydropower dam) probably. It revealed cooperation in the MRC PNPCA process that yielded a technical outcome. In my view, this is a very strong outcome. The MRCs review of the dams planned revealed shortcomings that then resulted in external pressure. It was important that this occurred right at the start once construction has commenced, then nothing can be changed. A design change was surprising this is not something I have ever seen in the hydropower world. What is unclear, however, is if the Xayaburi is now regarded as a standard for Lao hydropower now. Most of the noise re the PNPCA was from external science lobbying (eg World Fish), which did upset national representatives but introduced a dam review. If the review process and dam design guidance translates into new projects that will be real sign of cooperation success. "," When it comes to hydropower, regional conversation is between the utilities. This inhibits long-term sustainable development planning. In Laos, its between EGAT and EdL. The kinds of committees that the need for such discussions creates they do not work (and very limited focus). These need to be high-level discussions on sharing resources for hydropower discussion or production, rather than keeping this at the technical (utility) level. Regional trade-offs can then be considered for example, the trade-offs needed to address the regions massive carbon footprint, and whether or not addressing it is desirable; and if so, what needs to be traded-off to reduce it. When we discuss things at technical levels, we are focused on efficiencies, or quality of the cement we use, for example. Reality is a policy decision. You never ask an engineer if its possible, because theyll say that everything is possible. Coal and gas plants are very easy to build. They come out of a box, use existing technologies and components and can be funded by source countries (China and possibly Japan).(note previous mention of increasing coal and gas plants in Vietnam and Cambodia to meet projected industrial demand and avoid brown-outs). The lack of an interconnected grid (discussed in Laos since 2000) is an impediment to effective energy cooperation. "," I dont know. Id say that the two that have the greatest potential and who have exercised it are China and Vietnam. Vietnams economy is growing very fast and I think that they will become a regional economic power house and are similar to Thailand in the 1980s. They are also at the end of the system, with the delta providing much of their food. There is no empty space in Vietnam. I think theyre going to be making many more demands in the region. They (Vietnam) have a young demographic, and increasing exports to the US and EU. China is the main source of money in the region. As long as they have this, they will remain influential. But Mr Allen also mentions Myanmar, which he says has the highest (untapped) energy potential in the region. If it begins to address this, it could become very influential supplying power also to South Asia. Kim Geheb [Mekong Futures] asks if hydropower is actually cheap green energy are the prices not just kept down because they exclude downstream externalities? Mr. Allen responds that it depends on the hydropower site. A plant on a good site (characterised in part on plant factor and economic feasibility) has room to accommodate additional charges. Their managers might not like it, but the room exists. Plants on not as good sites should be left alone until prices improve to, say, US$0.2/KWh in all markets. In Laos, hydropower concessions last for a maximium of 30 years. If they were to do away with this system, and developers then plan for the lifetime of the plant (75 years, say) then they might look to spreading additional (external) charges over this period, which would also make them more manageable. The bottom line for investors is whether or not they can service their loans. Vietnam, Mr Allen mentions, has turned on its nuclear programme again. "," We look at (prioritize) economic development too much. People need food, shelter and clean water. This is the core that we should focus upon meeting and addressing. Beyond that, we can look to generating profits or economic growth. He provides the example of BC Hydro in British Colombia (in Canada), where their main goal is to supply the province with electricity at an affordable (low) price. Any surplus is for them to do with as they wish. BC Hydro has, therefore, started sending power to the US. So, we have to focus on the core (food shelter and clean water); everything beyond that is just bonus. Mr. Allen asked why fish protein deficiencies occurred in Cambodia before dam construction? We never get a balance between development and the environment. There will always be too much conflict. But perhaps if we focus on the core, this is acceptable. I dont know. We need to plan and evaluate what will be the new. Outside of China, the Thai banks have cash and seeking projects to make loans. But the Chinese banks have more, which is why theyre driving development here (in Laos). But right now, it is almost impossible to get a dollar out of China. (Referencing China Southern Power Grids purchase of 90% shares in EdL-Transmission) they will introduce efficiencies into the Lao power sector. He says he has heard rumours that they want to run the line as far as Phnom Penh","Robert Allen Jr,"," Managing Director,"," Theun-Hinboun Power Co. (Lao PDR),"
Interview 8 - Robert Allen.docx," Mr Allen felt that there were three key issues: first, that development has been progressing very rapidly that has led to both positive and negative impacts on the river. Industrial development has led to pollution, agricultural development has led to large amounts of water being syphoned off and agricultural runoff increased, housing development has led to increased demand for sand, etc. There hasnt been a systematic look at the potential impacts of development and where these will occur and no one talks about this. Other countries that have experienced rapid growth provide valuable lessons. Second, demand for electricity is growing regionally. It will be a big challenge to get the countries to talk with each other about power generation and supply, and for power systems to work together. Most decision-makers dont know anything about power production. By way of example, he pointed out that there is almost no storage hydropower in Laos (mostly one year) most of it is run-of-river. This casts up questions of coordination and planning between countries. Third, the issues of national sovereignty, and planning for individual countries rather than the region as a whole. He referenced what he saw as the US problems around water supply, expensive litigation and conflict, and his concerns around water wars implying that something similar could happen in the Mekong. "," Mr Allen felt that technical cooperation was something that was really missing from between the countries. The technical side of things gets too politicised. Political and technical cooperation gets mixed up, which, he felt, should not happen. The bigger problem is that the countries should be looking for ways to cooperate on, for example and generation demand planning, so that there is a net benefit for the region as a whole, rather than privileging individual nations. Forecasting (power) demand is very difficult. I dont know of a single utility in the world thats got it right. The Chinese have multi-year storage behind their dams; in Thailand, the dams have perhaps a years storage. This needs to be taken into account when it comes to planning discussions. Forecasting is nearly always national, and not regional. He pointed out that demand growth in NE Thailand is nearly always twice national demand and this rarely appears in the data. Laos doesnt have the technical capacity or an effective national grid to move electricity around. He also complained that weather forecasting is very poor in Laos. How El Nio or El Nia will affect Laos is something he can never find out, and this is data he needs to run his plant. Laos doe shave a national coordination group that meets to discuss export needs and likely dam water discharges "," Maybe the Xayaburi and its redesign to manage sediment flushing: not sure if those releases mimic natural sediment flux as no information has been forthcoming. But no, he cant really think of an example. "," There is a huge opportunity for technical data cooperation. Technical cooperation is not contentious. If you blend in the political it all becomes challenging. The LMC, he felt, could foster technical discussions in the Mekong. It is very hard to get treaties between more than two countries the political side of such conversations will be long and difficult. So, it is best to separate out technical cooperation from political this way, the technical cooperation can advance, while the political cooperation happens more slowly.

Interview 9 - Te Navuth.docx," There are five challenges: first, the Mekong region, with its growing population, requires economic development, so as to ensure that we have water, food and energy security. We need all of the countries to implement joint projects to address this. Second, the COVID pandemic: this has led to delays in all activities, tourism, etc. Third, climate change is of extreme relevance. There is increasing uncertainty with the rainfall regime, and there is often too much intense rainfall and flooding, including flash floods. Fourth, competition between various regional mechanisms he lists a variety there is a lack of coordination amongst these, and the competition between them is a challenge to geo-politics. Fifth, there is a lack of investment to support the region; in particular, a lack of support to help Cambodia deal with climate change. He references the delta where a wide variety of infrastructural interventions have helped them to adapt to climate change, including pumping stations, channels to release flood water, and others. Lack of coordination in financial/funding instruments for environmental protection and wetlands including implementation of research. "," We should recognise that the Mekong is very complex. Six countries, different economies, the relations between upstream and downstream countries, and geopolitical positions. The Mekong is very important to us all for water supply, irrigated agriculture, navigation, energy, ecosystems, and recreation, fisheries, etc. For HE Navuth, regional cooperation comprises solidarity, friendship and stability. Insofar as opportunities are concerned, HE Navuth identified partnership, networking, and shared future and vision, prosperity, planning, data and studies. He saw opportunities for joint efforts in partnerships, networking, dialogue, shared responsibility, a shared future, shared prosperity, shared basin planning, development and management. Also, sharing of data and information, studies and projects, joint work, involvement, and assisting riparian countries. And, finally, national and regional economic development. "," HE Navuth felt that the MRC and LMC were both examples of this. Reflecting on the MRC, he highlighted their five procedures, which are supported by the riparian countries. Also, the various MRC guidelines, its basin development strategy, and its five-year strategic plan. HE Navuth sought clarification if the World Bank would support with the MRC or LMC. Shelley MacMillan [World Bank] explained that it would not be prioritising any platform but sought to discover what the riparians seek and need and the means to improve riparian relations. Avoiding duplication or rivalry between platforms is also important. There are also the various sectoral strategies on fisheries, hydropower,the environment and climate change. In addition, there are the transboundary projects. HHE Navuth provides some example, of which are between two countries. Then there is the Joint Council (JC), the MRC Council, and the MRC Summit. As for the LMC, HE Navuth discusses the various joint working groups and technical-level meetings between ministers. At lower levels, there is meetings on various themes (e.g. the hydropower and the environment, flood monitoring, dam operations, joint environmental monitoring of dams) and training. There are also joint observation and assessment initiatives, for example on the impact of the Chinese dams on the downstream countries. China has also been notifying the downstream countries of water releases from their dams, and also information-sharing. HE Navuth also mentions Chinese releases of water to downstream countries during the dry season; and the special fund for small projects. Also, the Water Cooperation Centre, that works to smooth out cooperation between China and the lower Mekong countries on water issues. He also mentioned that the LMC is looking at a water management project for the Tonle Sap via the special fund. Within the MRC, he does not see any challenges that the countries have not been able to address under the JC. He mentions that the JC works well, given that its members have been working together for twenty to thirty years. He sees this as positive. HE Navuth explained that Cambodia-LMC relations fall under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One of the sectors on which it focuses is water, which then has its own sector working group. The latter is led by the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) and not the CNMC. From his own notes, HE Navuth provided the following responses to Question 3: From the MRC: Water Utilization Procedures and associated Technical Guidelines and their implementation, MRC Basin Development Strategy and Strategic Plan and multi-year work plan and implementation. Regional and sectoral (fish, environment) strategies and technical guidelines for sustainable development. Transboundary cooperation projects between the member countries: with Lao, Thailand and Vietnam, Coordinated river basin management. MRC Dialogue Partners and Summit. From the LMC: Training, technical workshop, symposium and Forum on technical and policy matters related to WRM, HP, Environment, etc. Exchange visit, joint studies and joint observation and assessment. Notification on HP release from HP in China. Establishing the LM WRC Information sharing platform, Exchange of data and information during flood season (extended to the whole year). Project development and implementation for Special Fund. Implementation of the 5-year work plan of the LM WR Cooperation. LM WR Cooperation (Working Group, Ministerial level). Foreign Affairs and Summit levels. "," Our team does not know all of the mechanisms that are out there. We are focused only on water. The different mechanisms should complement each other and promote investment. They (agendas and objectives) should not compete. Each has their own way of working with Mekong countries. They should deliver advantages to the Mekong governments. HE Navuth saw the main challenge as being the lack of cooperation coordination. Insofar as opportunities are concerned, HE Navuth spoke of joint dialogues; and cooperation to yield technical results. And we need financial support. He saw developing infrastructure for flood and drought management. Coordinating the various cooperative frameworks is also an opportunity. We need more grants from these frameworks, he said. They also need to work together with the MRC to support its implementation of its strategic plan. HE Navuth had no reflections on the MRC development partners. He said that he thought that they worked well together. He then reiterated the need for cooperation between the various frameworks. John Ward [Mekong Futures] asked if they feel that now cooperation is much more internally driven? HE Navuth replied by describing the two key MRC funding mechanisms: and basket fund, which the MRC can use for whatever it needs it for, in line with its strategic plan; and ear-marked funds which are bilateral funds for specific but relevant issues, which the MRC welcomes. HE Navuth mentioned the Japan flood/catchment project. From his own notes, HE Navuth provided the following: Advantages: Joint efforts, investment for economic development, regional prosperity, to complimenting and not to competing each other. More competitive fund, more opportunities for economic development. Good governance for the Mekong-Lancang basin, contributing to sustainable development, Disadvantages: Lack of cooperation coordination. Not consistent principle of cooperation ... "," HE Te Navuth lists indicators of success as working together; sharing data (that extends into the dry season); LMC cooperation and special fund projects; high level commitment and political will; and joint action plans. Tangible achievements include bridges, roads and highways what you can see with your eyes. Also, the amount of funding the number and magnitude of loans or grants. In addition, economic development activity such as trade. From his own notes, HE Navuth provided the following: Success: Working together, sharing of data and information, joint project implementation, real investment. Economic development and prosperity. High level commitment and political will, clear Declaration and Joint Action Plan. "," Economic development this is the most active type of programme under the LMC: roads, bridges, highways or other infrastructure. Also, regional stability and peace this is the most effective way to cooperate. Joint assessments and sharing information (he highlights the LMCs data-sharing) are others. Also, scholarships and training. "," No money to follow up negotiations to achieve agreements. This prevents cooperation; in addition, research without country involvement; and lack of coordination. Faithful cooperation and the political will to enable it; not introducing too much geopolitics, are enablers. ", Chinese-US relations (Joke). We respect international law and regulations. Cambodia needs to become rich so that it too can become influential. ," The first is that governments should consider national interests and priorities and how these relate to regional ones. There needs to be high commitment and political will to balance the environment with economics. Decisions by higher level authorities need to be based on data, technical tools, and a scientific base to inform decision-making to ensure sustainable development. Trade-offs between benefits and costs need to be made. HE Navuth references something he calls impact sharing which he sees as countries developing (and benefitting) while impacting downstream countries. The countries should consider the impacts on downstream countries. There should also be stakeholder participation and consultation. John Ward asks if problems like the water-food-energy nexus need a different type of cooperation? HE Navuth replies that the different sectors need to talk to each other to balance development. This is the IWRM principles for appropriate resource use. Sometimes, they dont talk with each other. This is one of the challenges. He mentioned trust as reciprocity, participatory, respectful as principles of cooperation","HE Te Navuth,"," Vice Chair,"," Cambodia National Mekong Committee,"
